Saw troops of men at arms, and footmen spread;
Who, to the drum and trumpet marching by,
Divided into goodly bands, were led
Before Rinaldo, flower of chivalry;
He that (if you remember it was said ) 

To have been sent by Charlemagne, and made
His envoy to these parts in search of aid.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>Rogero came exactly as the show
Of that fair host was made without the town,
And of a knight the occasion sought to know;
But from the griffin-horse first lighted down:
And he who courteous was, informed him how
Of kingdoms holding of the British crown,
English, Scotch, Irish, and the Islands</pre></div> </div>
