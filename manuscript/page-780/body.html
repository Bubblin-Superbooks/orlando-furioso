Of the fell orc, and those he made his prey,
Then he, without more thought, would him pursue
And follow, wheresoe'er he bent his way.

With which the rage of love a man supplies,

Than e'er were suffered, there await in dread
The orc, and deem at every sound we hear,
The famished brute about to re-appear.</pre><h5>XXXIX</h5><pre class="  ">"The monarch to the cave did Fortune guide,
