But to their strife Rinaldo puts an end;
He shows himself in arms before the train,
Saying, " 'Tis time that we to Paris wend;
For us too long the tourney will detain,
If I expect till each his course has run,
And ye are all unseated, one by one."</p><blockquote><p>XIII</p></blockquote><p>So spake the knight, yet spake not in a tone
To be o'erheard in what he inly said;
Who thus foul scorn would to the rest have done.
Both now had wheeled, and fierce encounter made.
In the career Rinaldo was not thrown,
Who all the banded kinsmen much outweighed;
Their spears like brittle glass to pieces went,
But not an inch the champions backward bent.</p><blockquote><p>XIV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The chargers such a rough encounter made,
That on his crupper sank each staggering horse:

Scarcely to interrupt his rapid</p></div> </div>
