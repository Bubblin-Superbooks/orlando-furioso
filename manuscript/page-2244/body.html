Beside her own Rogero, she will fain
Do what so can be done; her word belie;
Anger friends, kindred, court, and Charlemagne;
And if she nothing else can do, will die,
By poison or her own good faulchion slain:
For not to live appears far lesser woe,
Than, living, her Rogero to forego.</p><blockquote><p>XCVII</p></blockquote><p>"Rogero mine, ah!  wonder gone" (she cried)
"Art thou; and canst thou so far distant be,
Thou heardest not this royal edict cried,
A thing concealed from none, expecting thee?
Faster than thee would none have hither hied,
I wot, hadst thou known this; ah!  wretched me!
How can I e'er in future think of aught,
Saving the worst that can by me be thought?</p><blockquote><p>XCVIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
