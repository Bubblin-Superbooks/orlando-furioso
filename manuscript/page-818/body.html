<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For a renowned and valiant cavalier
Has the true history vaunted, Sansonnet,
By Roland christened, Charles (I said), the peer
Over the Holy Land as ruler set:
He with the duke takes up his load, to steer
Thither, where Rumour speaks the champions met.
So that his ears, on all sides in the journey,
Are filled with tidings of Damascus' tourney.</p><blockquote><p>XCVIII</p></blockquote><p>Thither the twain their way those countries through,
By easy stages and by slow, addrest,
That fresh upon the day of joust the two
Might in Damascus-town set up their rest.
When at the meeting of cross-ways they view
A person, who, in movement and in vest,
Appears to be a man, but is a maid;
And marvellously fierce, in martial raid.</p><blockquote><p>XCIX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Marphisa was the warlike virgin's name,
And such</p></div> </div>
