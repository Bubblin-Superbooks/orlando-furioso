At court; and she who with the peer did ride
Was honoured by the courteous king as well,
— False Origille, — with knight and page supplied.
But it is time that I of Gryphon tell;
Who unsuspecting, she, or wight beside,

Had fallen asleep, nor ever waked till eve.</pre><h5>CXIV</h5><pre>When he how late it was, awaking, knew,
With speed he from the chamber did withdraw;
And hastened where he, with the other crew,
Left Origille and her false brother-in-law:
And when, nor these, nor, upon better view,
His armour nor his wonted clothes he saw,
Suspicious waxed; and more suspicion bred
The ensigns of his comrade left instead.</pre><h5>CXV</h5></div> </div>
