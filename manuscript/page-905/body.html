And overtook the wretch, and cleft (before
He the mid square had won his collar through, )</p><p>So clean, no surgeon ever pieced it more.
One after other, all in fine she slew,
Or wounded every one she smote so sore,
She was secure, that never more would foe
Arise anew from earth, to work her woe.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVIII</p></blockquote><p>The cavalier this while had stood aside,
Who had the ten conducted to the place,
Since, with so many against one to ride,
Had seemed to him advantage four and base;
Who, now he by a single hand espied
So speedily his whole array displaced,
Pricked forth against the martial maid, to show
'Twas courtesy, not fear, had made him slow.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
