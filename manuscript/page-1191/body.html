Brimfull of rage and choler, at his side,
The Tartar held him, grappled by the mane.
"Put upon him" (to Mandricardo cried
His lady, Doralice "my hackney's rein, ) 

Since for the bridle I have little use;
For gentle is my palfrey, reined or loose."</pre><h5>XCII</h5><pre>The paynim deems it were discourtesy
To accept the proffer by the damsel made.
But his through other means a rein will be;
Since Fortune, who his wishes well appaid,
Made thitherward the false Gabrina flee,
After she young Zerbino had betrayed:
Who like a she-wolf fled, which, as she hies,
At distance hears the hounds and hunters' cries.</pre><h5>XCIII</h5></div> </div>
