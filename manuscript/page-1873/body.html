So saying, in his hand the holy book
Charles held, and fixed on heaven his earnest look.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXV</p></blockquote><p>This done, they seek that altar, sumptuously
Decked for the purpose, by the pagan train;
Where their king swears, that he will pass the sea,
With all his army, to his Moorish reign,
And to King Charles will tributary be;
If vanquished, young Rogero shall remain;
And will observe the truce for evermore
Upon the pact declared by Charles before;</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And like him, nor in under tone, he swears,
Calling on Mahound to attest his oath;
And on the volume which his pontiff bears,
To observe what he has promised plights his troth.
Then to his side each hastily repairs;
And mid their several powers are harboured</p></div> </div>
