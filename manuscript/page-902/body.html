Wilder, shows worse by day, — if this be day,
Which but by reckoning of the hours is known,
And not by any cheering light or ray.
Now, with more fear (his weaker hope o'erthrown).
The sorrowing Patron to the wind gives way,
He veers his barque before the cruel gale,
And scowers the foaming sea with humble sail.</pre><h5>CXLVI</h5><pre>While Fortune on the sea annoys this crew,
She grants those others small repose by land,
Those left in France, who one another slew, —
The men of England and the paynim band.
These bold Rinaldo broke and overthrew;
Nor troops nor banners spread before him stand:
I speak of him, who his Baiardo fleet
Had spurred the gallant Dardinel to meet.</pre></div> </div>
