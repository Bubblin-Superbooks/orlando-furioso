Half surging and half hidden, in such sort
As sped by roaring wind long carack steers
From north or south, towards her destined port.
So the sea monster to his food repairs:
And now the interval between is short.
Half dead the lady is through fear endured,
Ill by that other's comfort reassured.</code></pre><blockquote><p>CI</p></blockquote><pre><code>Rogero overhand, not in the rest
Carries his lance, and beats, with downright blow,
The monstrous orc.  What this resembled best,
But a huge, writhing mass, I do not know;
Which wore no form of animal exprest,
Save in the head, with eyes and teeth of sow.
His forehead, 'twixt the eyes, Rogero smites,
But as on steel or rock the weapon lights.</code></pre><blockquote><p>CII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
