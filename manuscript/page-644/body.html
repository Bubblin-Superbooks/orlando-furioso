But to permit their sally deems not meet.</pre><h5>CIII</h5><pre>And them he ordered in convenient post,
The advance of the barbarians to impede:
For this would ill suffice a numerous host,
To that he was content that few should speed.
Some worked at the machines, some wild-fire tost,
All ranged according to the separate need.
Charles, never in one place, with restless care
Provides defence and succour every where.</pre><h5>CIV</h5><pre class="  ">Paris is seated on a spacious plain,
I' the midst â€” the heart of France, more justly say.
A stream flows into it, and forth again;
But first, the passing waters, as they stray,
An island form, and so secure the main
And better part, dividing on their way.
