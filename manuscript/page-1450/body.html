And Echo oft, for pity of his woes,
With him from hollow rock is heard to mourn:
"O female mind!  how lightly ebbs and flows
Your fickle mood," (he cries, "aye prone to turn! ) 

Object most opposite to kindly faith!
Lost, wretched man, who trusts you to his scathe!</pre><h5>CXVIII</h5><pre>"Neither my love nor length of servitude,
Though by a thousand proofs to you made clear,
Had power even so to fix your faithless mood,
That you at least so lightly should not veer:
Nor am I quitted, because less endued
With worth than Mandricardo I appear;
Nor for your conduct cause can I declare,
Save this alone, that you a woman are.</pre><h5>CXIX</h5></div> </div>
