I know not when nor where (the youth replied);
For I too range the world, in armour sheen,
Seeking adventure strange on every side;
Or haply it a sister may have been,
Who to her waist the knightly sword has tied;
Born with me at a birth; so like to view,
The family discerns not who is who.</pre><h5>XXIII</h5><pre class="  ">"You not first, second, or even fourth will be,
Who have in this their error had to learn;
Nor father, brother, nor even mother me
