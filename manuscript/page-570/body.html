<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Orlando lops the branches with his glaive,
And hangs the thieves, a banquet for the crows:
Nor chain and crook for such a deed did crave:
For ready hooks the tree itself bestows,
To purge the world; where by the chin up-hung,
These, on the branches, bold Orlando strung.</pre><h5>XLII</h5><pre>The ancient woman, the assassin's friend,
Escapes when she perceives that all are dead,
And, threading that green labyrinth without end,
Laments, and plucks the hair from off her head,
By fear impelled, through paths which sore offend
Her feet, till she, beside a river's bed,
Encounters with a warrior: but to say
Who was the stranger champion I delay;</pre><h5>XLIII</h5><pre class="  ">And turn to her, who to the count applied,
Praying he would not leave her there alone,
