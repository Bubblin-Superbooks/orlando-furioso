He in the flank, with thrust so full and dread,
Encountered, that it went through either side:

If Ariodantes, when his brother fell,
Was grieved; if he with his avenging hand
Among the damned would send Sir Dardinell;

And bar, no less baptized than infidel:

Whoever cross him on the crowded plain;
And Dardinello, who his object knows,
Would fain the wish content; but him the train
