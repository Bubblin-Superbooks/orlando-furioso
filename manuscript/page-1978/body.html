" `Tis sure temerity and madness sheer
Moves you and whatsoever wight beside,

Uncalled a counsellor's duty to fulfil;</p><blockquote><p>XLIII</p></blockquote><p>"And how to think, from love those counsels flow

And marked for the devouring dragon's prey,
Ye all mankind would drag to nether hell,
In your eternity of pains to dwell.</p><blockquote><p>XLIV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"If I shall win or lose, remount my throne,
Or pass my future days in exile drear,
