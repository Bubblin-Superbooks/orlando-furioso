And Neptune's white herd lows above the main.
As many deaths appear to daunt that rout,
As waves which beat their troubled bark about.</pre><h5>X</h5><pre>Now blows the wind in front, and now in rear,
And drives this wave an-end, that other back;
Others the reeling vessel's side o'erpeer;
And every billow threatens equal wrack.
The pilot sighs, confused and pale with fear;
Vainly he calls aloud to shift the tack,
To strike or jibe the yard; and with his hand,
Signs to the crew the thing he would command.</pre><h5>XI</h5><pre class="  ">But sound or signal little boots; the eye
Sees not amid the dim and rainy night;
The voice unheard ascends into the sky, â€”
The sky, which with a louder larum smite
