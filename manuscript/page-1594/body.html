Until he there embrace the friendly throng
Each hour appears to him a twelvemonth long.</pre><h5>XCIII</h5><pre>His course to Mont Albano had he ta'en;
And, there embracing wife and children dear,

Richard, Alardo, and Richardet' combined,
Vivian and Malagigi, wend their way
In arms, the martial paladin behind.
Bradamant, waiting the appointed day,
