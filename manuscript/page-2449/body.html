That warlike band hath ceased to clip the knight,
Tells before Charles and all that audience, how
Rogero's daring, how Rogero's might,
— Albeit to his good squadron's scathe and woe —

So moved him that they overweighed all harms
Inflicted on him by the warrior's arms.</pre><h5>LXII</h5><pre>So that to her Rogero being brought,
Who would all havoc of the youth have made,

By Leo might be worthily repaid,
Did that high courtesy; which can by none,
That ever were or e'er will be, outdone;</pre><h5>LXIII</h5></div> </div>
