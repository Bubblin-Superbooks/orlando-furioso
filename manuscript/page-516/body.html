Has not stretched forth his hand the prize to gain.
For so it was, that neither of the pair
Could recognise the other knight while there.</pre><h5>XXXII</h5><pre>Upon the enchanted dome lay such a spell,
That they from one another were concealed;
They doffed not, night nor day, the corselet's shell,
Not sword, nor even put aside the shield.
Saddled, with bridle hanging at the sell,
Their steeds were feeding, ready for the field,
Within a chamber, near the palace door,
With straw and barley heaped in plenteous store.</pre><h5>XXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">Nor might nor mean in old Atlantes lies
To stop the knights from mounting, who repair
To their good steeds, to chase the bright black eyes,
The fair vermillion cheeks and golden hair
