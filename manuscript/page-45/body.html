Nigh his death-stricken cattle, wakes aghast,
And sees the distant pine without its crown,
Which he saw clad in leafy honours last;
So rose the paynim knight with troubled face,
The maid spectatress of the cruel case.</p><blockquote><p>LXVI</p></blockquote><p>He sighs and groans, yet not for mischief sore

Had not his prisoned tongue and voice set free.</p><blockquote><p>LXVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Grieve not," she said, "sir monarch, for thy fall;
But let the blame upon thy courser be!
To whom more welcome had been forage, stall,
And rest, than further</p></div> </div>
