<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The other knight, whose worth I rate as high,
His warlike prowess puts to present test;
Cuts short his haughty threats and angry cry,
And spurs, and lays his levelled lance in rest.
In tempest wheels Circassia's valiant peer,
And at his foeman's head each aims his spear.</pre><h5>LXII</h5><pre>Not brindled bulls or tawny lions spring
To forest warfare with such deadly will
As those two knights, the stranger and the king.
Their spears alike the opposing bucklers thrill:
The solid ground, at their encountering,
Trembles from fruitful vale to naked hill:
And well it was the mail in which they dressed
Their bodies was of proof, and saved the breast.</pre><h5>LXIII</h5><pre class="  ">Nor swerved the chargers from their destined course;
Who met like rams, and butted head to head.
