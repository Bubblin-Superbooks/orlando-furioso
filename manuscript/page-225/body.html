Thus by my cause the royal damsel die;
My death too bitter and too dread would be,
Did I, before my own, her death descry;
For still my lady, my divinity
She is; â€” the light and comfort of my eye.
Her, right or wrong, I cannot choose but shield,
And for her safety perish in the field.</pre><h5>XI</h5><pre class="  ">"I know I choose the wrong, and be it so!

But that, alas!  my death, as well I know,
Will such a lovely dame's destruction prove,
To death I with one only comfort go,
