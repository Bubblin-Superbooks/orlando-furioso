Or was it on the hill of Helicon?
'Tis Beatrice, who next uprears her front,
Whereof so speaks the writing on the stone:
"Her consort Beatrice, while she has breath,
Blesses, and leaves unhappy at her death;</pre><h5>XCII</h5><pre>"Yea, Italy; that with her triumphs bright,
Without that lady fair shall captive be."
A lofty song appears of her to indite
A lord of the Correggio's noble tree;
And, Benedeo's pride, Timotheus hight.
Between his banks, descending to the sea,
By their joint music shall the stream be stopt,
Whose trees erewhile the liquid amber dropt.</pre><h5>XCIII</h5><pre class="  ">Between this and that lofty column's place
Into fair Borgia fashioned (as was said)
