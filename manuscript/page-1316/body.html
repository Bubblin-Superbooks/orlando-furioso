Had laboured to procure by actions fair,
And having gained it thus, he held it dear,
— If this had sought to keep — with greater care
He kept it now, — and with a miser's fear
Guarded the treasure she with him would share;
Who, though distinct in body and in limb,
When wedded, ought to be one soul with him;</pre><h5>LXXXIX</h5><pre>And, as he erst by word, he now explained

For which he was to serve his king constrained,
Unless it were his lot to die before,
He would in deed a Christian be ordained,
As in resolve he had been evermore;
And of her kin, Rinaldo and her sire,
Her afterwards in wedlock would require.</pre></div> </div>
