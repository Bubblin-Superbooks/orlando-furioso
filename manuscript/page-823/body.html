<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h5>CXXIII</h5><pre>That vessel of all filthy vices, he,
Made answer: "Mighty sir, I cannot say
Who is the stranger, that fell in with me
Journeying from Antioch hither, by the way:
But him I worthy of my company
Deemed, by his warlike semblance led astray.
I nothing of his deeds have heard or seen,
Save what ill feats to-day have witnessed been;</pre><h5>CXXIV</h5><pre>"Which moved me so, it little lacked but I,
For punishment of his unworthy fear,
Had put him out of case again to ply,
In martial tournament, the sword or spear;
And, but in reverence to your majesty
And presence, I forbore by hand to rear,
Not for his sake: â€” nor by thy mercy showed
On him, as my companion on the road;</pre></div> </div>
