<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">That mountains never meet, but that men may,
And oft encounter, is an ancient say.</pre><h5>II</h5><pre>Now mark what chanced to Pinnabel, the event
Of having borne himself so wickedly:
He at the last received due punishment,
Due and deserved by his iniquity.
And God, who for the most is ill content
To see the righteous suffer wrongfully,
Secured the maid from harm, and will secure
All who from every wickedness are pure.</pre><h5>III</h5><pre class="  ">Pinnabel deemed he to an end had brought,
And buried deep in earth, the martial maid;
Nor weening to behold her more, less thought
To her his treason's forfeit to have paid.
Nor profits it the wily traitor ought
To be among the forts his father swayed.
