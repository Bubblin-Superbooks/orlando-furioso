To free thee from each churlish deed I fear;
As, when in the dark cavern thou wast stayed,
He sent, to rescue thee, Anglante's peer;
So he (grammercy! succoured thee dismaid )</p><p>At sea, and from the wicked Biscayneer.
And, if thou must choose death, in place of worse,
Then only choose it, as a lesser curse."</p><blockquote><p>LXXXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I think not these last words of Scotland's knight

With these, he finished, like a feeble light,
Which needs supply of was, or other food.
