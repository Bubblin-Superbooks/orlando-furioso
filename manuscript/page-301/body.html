So feigning, from the wanton dome possessed
By that old strumpet, rode the cavalier;
And pricking forth drew near unto a gate,
Whence the road led to Logistilla's state.</pre><h5>LXXX</h5><pre>Assaulting suddenly the guardian crew,
He, sword in hand, the squadron set upon;

At last the realm where Logistilla reigned.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
