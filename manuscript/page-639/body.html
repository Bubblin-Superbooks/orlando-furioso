<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">spread,
And every ditch with human blood was red.</p><blockquote><p>LI</p></blockquote><p>Caligorant was standing at the gate
(For so was the  despiteous monster hight);
Who decked his house with corpses, as for state
Some theirs with cloth of gold and scarlet dight.
He scarce contained himself for joy, so great
His pleasure, when the duke appeared in sight;
For 'twas two months complete, a third was near,
Since by that road had past a cavalier.</p><blockquote><p>LII</p></blockquote><p>Towards the marish, where green rushes grow,
He hastes, intending from that covert blind
To double on his unsuspecting foe,
And issue on the cavalier behind:
For him to drive into the net, below
The sand, the griesly giant had designed;
As others trapt he had been wont to see,
Brought thither by their evil destiny.</p><blockquote><p>LIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
