<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Ah!  turn to me, Rogero!  turn again,
And comfort Hope, whom Fear hath almost slain.</pre><h5>XXXVI</h5><pre>"As when the sun withdraws his glittering head,
The shadows lengthen, causing vain affright;
And as the shadows, when he leaves his bed,
Vanish, and reassure the timid wight:
Without Rogero so I suffer dread;
Dread lasts not, if Rogero is in sight.
Return to me, return, Rogero, lest
My hope by fear should wholly be opprest.</pre><h5>XXXVII</h5><pre class="  ">"As every spark is in the night alive,
And suddenly extinguished when 'tis morn;
When me my sun doth of his rays deprive,
Against me felon Fear uplifts his horn:
But they the shades of night no sooner drive,
Than Fears are past and gone, and Hopes return.
