Oh!  cruel Fortune!  who believed thy sway
Was of such passing power in things below?
That thou shouldst make a hideous monster's prey

Brought with half Scythia's people from the gates
Of Caucasus, in Ind, to find their fates.</pre><h5>LXIII</h5><pre>The beauty, by Circassian Sacripant
Preferred before his honour and his crown,
The beauty which made Roland, Brava's vaunt,

The beauty which had moved the wide Levant,
And awed, and turned its kingdom upside down,
Now has not (thus deserted and unheard)
One to assist it even with a word.</pre><h5>LXIV</h5><pre class="  ">Oppressed with heavy sleep upon the shore,
