By him that famous castle shall be quelled,
Which inexpugnable whilere was held.</pre><h5>XLVI</h5><pre>"In quelling it his honoured faulchion, more
Than other arms, availing shall be found;
Which first that cruel Beast to death will gore,
The foul destroyer of each country round:
Parforce will every standard fly before
That conquering faulchion, or be cast to ground:
Nor, stormed by it, will rampart, fosse, or wall,
Secure the city, they surround, from fall.</pre><h5>XLVII</h5><pre class="  ">"Imbued with every generous quality,
Which can in great commander be combined,
â€” Prudence like his who won Thrasymenae
And Trebbia's field, with Caesar's daring mind,
And Alexander's fortune, him I see;
