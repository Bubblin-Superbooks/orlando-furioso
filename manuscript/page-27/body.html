The brother of Angelica.  That knight
Am I; â€” thy word was plighted then to throw
After my other arms his helmet bright.
If Fortune now compel thee to forego
The prize, and do my will in thy despite,
Grieve not at this, but rather grieve that thou
Art found a perjured traitor to thy vow.</p><blockquote><p>XXVIII</p></blockquote><p>"But if thou seek'st a helmet, be thy task
To win and wear it more to thy renown.
A noble prize were good Orlando's casque;
Rinaldo's such, or yet a fairer crown;
Almontes', or Mambrino's iron masque:
Make one of these, by force of arms, thine own.
And this good helm will fitly be bestowed
Where (such thy promise it has long been owed." )</p><blockquote><p>XXIX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Bristled the paynim's every hair at view
