But good Rinaldo and Bradamant at heart,
(One for Angelica, the other sighs
For young Rogero suffer cruel smart. ) 

Him that in chase of the Indian damsel hies
Disdain preserves; from thence does he depart
Towards Italy, and is with courteous cheer
And welcome guested by a cavalier.</pre><h5>I</h5><pre class="  ">What bit, what iron curb is to be found,
Or (could it be what adamantine rein, ) 

That can make wrath keep order and due bound,
And within lawful limits him contain?
