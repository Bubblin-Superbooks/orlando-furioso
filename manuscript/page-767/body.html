And ever 'twill sit heavy at my heart,
If I, uninjured, see the wretch again
'Scape, to the scandal of the warlike art.
'Twere better he from tower, a worthy pain,
Were gibbeted, than suffered to depart:
Hung as a beacon for the coward's gaze.
Such were a princely deed, and worthy praise."</p><blockquote><p>CXXVI</p></blockquote><p>A voucher he in Origilla had,
Who well, without a sign, his purpose read.
"I deem not," cried the king, "his works so bad,
That they should cost the stranger knight his head:
Enough that he again the people glad,
For penance of his weighty sin."  This said,
He quickly called a baron of his crew,
And him enjoined the deed he was to do.</p><blockquote><p>CXXVII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
