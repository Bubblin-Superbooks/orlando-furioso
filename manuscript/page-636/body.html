And knight and damsel views with equal eye,
And for his prisoners' worth has little care.

Casts forth their bones upon the desert lair;
And round about his griesly palace pins,
For horrid ornament, their bloody skins.</p><blockquote><p>XLVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Take this, â€” my son, oh!  take this other way,
