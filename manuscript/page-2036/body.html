That from long self-neglect, while wild he ran,
Had in his visage more of beast than man.</pre><h5>XLVI</h5><pre>With breast and heart transfixed with pity, cried
Valiant Astolpho — bathed with many a tear —
Turning to Danish Dudon, at this side,
And afterwards to valiant Olivier;
"Behold Orlando!"  Him awhile they eyed,
Straining their eyes and lids; then knew the peer;
And, seeing him in such a piteous plight,
Were filled with grief and wonder at the sight.</pre><h5>XLVII</h5><pre class="  ">So grieve and so lament the greater part
Of those good warriors, that their eyes o'erflow.
" `Tis time" (Astolpho cried "to find some art ) 

To heal him, not indulge in useless woe";
