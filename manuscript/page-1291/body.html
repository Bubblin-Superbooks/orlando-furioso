To her desire some hope of  ease supplies;
And when she thinks she is indeed a maid,
Laments and sobs, with mighty woe downweighed.</pre><h5>XXXIV</h5><pre>"He who had marked her sorrow and lament,
That day, himself had sorrowed with the fair.
`What pains (she said did ever wight torment, ) 

So cruel, but that mine more cruel were?
I need not to accomplish my intent,
In other love, impure or pure, despair;
The rose I well might gather from the thorn:
My longing only is of hope forlorn.</pre><h5>XXXV</h5><pre class="  ">" `It 'twas thy pleasure, Love, to have me shent,
Because by glad estate thine anger stirred,
Thou with some torture might'st have been content
