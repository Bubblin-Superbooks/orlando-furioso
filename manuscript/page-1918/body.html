And plainer were the plaintive words they heard:
When in a valley they three women found
Making that plaint, who in strange garb appeared:
For to the navel were those three ungowned,
— Their coats by some uncourteous varlet sheared —
And knowing not how better to disguise
Their shame, they sate on earth, and dared not rise.</pre><h5>XXVII</h5><pre>As Vulcan's son, that sprang (as it is versed)
Out of the dust, without a mother made,
Whom — so Minerva bade — Aglauros nursed
With sovereign care, too bold and curious maid,
Seated in car, by him constructed first
To hide his hideous feet, was erst conveyed;
So that which never is to sight revealed,
Sitting, those mournful damsels kept concealed.</pre></div> </div>
