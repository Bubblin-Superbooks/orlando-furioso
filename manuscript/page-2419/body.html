I see the friendly port its arms expand.</pre><h5>II</h5><pre>A burst of joy, like thunder to my ear,
Rumbles along the sea and rends the sky.
I chiming bells, I shrilling trumpets hear,
Confounded with the people's cheerful cry;
And now their forms, that swarm on either pier
Of the thick-crowded harbour, I descry.
All seem rejoiced my task is smoothly done,
And I so long a course have safely run.</pre><h5>III</h5><pre class="  ">What beauteous dames and sage, here welcome me!
With them what cavaliers the shore adorn!
What friends!  to whom I owe eternity
Of thanks for their delight at my return.
Mamma, Ginevra, with the rest I see,
Correggio's seed, on the harbour's furthest horn.
