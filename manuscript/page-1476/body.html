The ground that melancholy stripling eyed.
Faustus, who vainly would apply relief,
Ill cheered him, witless what had caused his grief.</pre><h5>XXVI</h5><pre>"He for his sore an evil salve had found,
And, where he should retire, encreased his woes;
Who, with the mention of his wife, that wound
Inflamed and opened, which he sought to close.
He rests not night nor day, in sorrow drowned;
His appetite is gone, with his repose,
Ne'er to return; and (whilom of such fame)
His lovely visage seems no more the same.</pre><h5>XXVII</h5><pre class="  ">"His eye-balls seem deep-buried in his head,
His nose seems grown — his cheeks are pined so sore —
Nor even remains (his beauty so is fled)
