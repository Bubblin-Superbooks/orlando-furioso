Where, in the field, 'mid bow and falchion, lay,
And shield and spear, in pool of purple stain,
Wealthy and poor, the king and vassal's corse,
And overthrown the rider and his horse.</pre><h5>CLXXXIII</h5><pre>The horrid mixture of the bodies there
Which heaped the plain where roved these comrades sworn,
Might well have rendered vain their faithful care
Amid the mighty piles, till break of morn,
Had not the moon, at young Medoro's prayer,
Out of a gloomy cloud put forth her horn.
Medoro to the heavens upturns his eyes
Towards the moon, and thus devoutly cries:</pre><h5>CLXXXIV</h5><pre class="  ">"O holy goddess!  whom our fathers well
Have styled as of a triple form, and who
Thy sovereign beauty dost in heaven, and hell,
