And be into a thousand pieces torn.
Whereas if you had made me kinder cheer,
Haply from me the secret might you hear."</pre><h5>CXXXIX</h5><pre>As the dog's rage is quickly overblown,
Who flies the approaching robber to arrest,
If the thief proffer piece of bread or bone,
Of offer other lure which likes him best;
As readily Zerbino to the crone
Humbled himself, and burned to know the rest;
Who, in the hints of the old woman, read
That she had news of her he mourned as dead.</pre><h5>CXL</h5><pre class="  ">And with more winning mien to her applied,
And her did supplicate, entreat, conjure,
By men and gods, the truth no more to hide,
Did she benign or evil lot endure.
