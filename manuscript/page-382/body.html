That prayer and protest are alike in vain;
My town and me, with Friesland's king agreed,
Surrendered, as they vowed, my vassal train.
Not doing by me any shameful deed,
Me he assured of life and of domain,
So I would soften my obdurate mood,
And be to wed with his Arbantes wooed.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXVI</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>"I who would have consented to forego
My life to scape from him, reflection made,
