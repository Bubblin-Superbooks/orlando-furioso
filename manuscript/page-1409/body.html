Has that forgotten which at his heart-core,
As precious as his life and soul should be,
Hastes to repair his error, nor before

So not to God St. Michael will ascend
Until he has achieved his holy end.</pre><h5>XXXVII</h5><pre class="  ">Again he to that monastery flew,
Where whilom he had Discord seen; and there
Seated in chapter sees her, while anew
Their yearly officers elected are,
She taking huge delight those friers to view,
That at each other hurled their books of prayer.
His hand within her locks the archangel twists,
