He lent, who weened if he his way forbore
For anything, each lett would time supply
To Alcina to arrive, who now was nigh.</pre><h5>XL</h5><pre>Now so saltpetre fine and sulphur pure,
Touched with the fiery spark, blaze suddenly;
Not so loud ocean raves, when the obscure
Whirlwind descends and camps in middle sea,
As viewing thus the knight proceed secure
Upon his journey, and aware that he
Scorns them, who yet believe they beauteous are,
Kindled the third of those three damsels fair.</pre><h5>XLI</h5><pre class="  ">As loud as she could raise her voice, she said,
"Thou art not gentle, nor art thou a knight;
And hast from other arms and horse conveyed:
Which never could be thine by better right.
