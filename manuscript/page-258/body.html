The balmy breath collecting, he embraced:
Rich perfume this, whose like no seed or slip
Bears in sweet Indian or Sabacan waste;

Worshipped of all those inmates, who fulfil
In this the enamoured far, Alcina's will.</p><blockquote><p>XXXI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">No pleasure is omitted there; since they
Alike are prisoners in Love's magic hall.
They change their raiment twice or thrice a day,
