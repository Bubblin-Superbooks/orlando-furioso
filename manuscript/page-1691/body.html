— Your witcheries, O women! — he explored.
The things he witnessed, to recount in rhyme
Too tedious were; were myriads on record,
To sum the remnant ill should I have time.
'Tis here that all infirmities are stored,
Save only Madness, seen not here at all,
Which dwells below, nor leaves this earthly ball.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXII</p></blockquote><p>He turns him back, upon some days and deeds
To look again, which he had lost of yore;
But, save the interpreter the lesson reads,
Would know them not, such different form they wore.
He next saw that which man so little needs,
— As it appears — none pray to Heaven for more;
I speak of sense, whereof a lofty mount
Alone surpast all else which I recount.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
