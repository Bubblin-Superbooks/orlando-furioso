For Charles's court (as hath erewhile been shown),
Hoping to find the knight, whose shield pourtrayed
The unicorn, elected to their throne,
Bless the good fortune which their hope repayed,
Seeing that valiant warrior, and fall down
Before his feet, and him in humble speech
Again to seek their Bulgary beseech;</pre><h5>LXX</h5><pre>Where kept for him in Adrianople are
The sceptre and the crown, his royal due:
But let him succour to his kingdom bear;
For — to their further scathe — advices shew
Constantine doth a mighty host prepare,
And thitherward in person moves anew;
And they — of their elected king possest —
Hope the Greek empire from his hands to wrest.</pre><h5>LXXI</h5></div> </div>
