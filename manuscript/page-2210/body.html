He that would with Duke Aymon's daughter wed
Must with the sword contend against that dame
From the suns rise until he seeks his bed;
And if he for that time maintains the game,
And is not overcome, without more said,
The lady is adjudged to have lost the stake;
Nor him for husband can refuse to take.</p><blockquote><p>XXIV</p></blockquote><p>The choice of arms must be by her foregone,
No matter who may claim it in the course:
And by the damsel this may well be done,
Good at all arms alike, on foot or horse.
Aymon, who cannot strive against the crown,
— Cannot and will not — yields at length parforce.
He much the matter sifts, and in the end
Resolves to court with Bradamant to wend.</p><blockquote><p>XXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
