But bid no less her purpose to pursue;
For he had taken thought for her; and aid
Should in the time of peril be purveyed.</pre><h5>CXXV</h5><pre>"The servant from his pathway turns aside,
And through bye-roads and solitary goes;
Purposely lighting on a stream, whose tide
From Apennine into our river flows;
Where, both of farm and busy city wide,
A holt, and dark and dismal greenwood grows.
Silent appeared the gloomy place, and one
Fitting the cruel deed which should be done.</pre><h5>CXXVI</h5><pre class="  ">"He drew his sword on her, and signified
The mandate by her angry husband given;
That so she might entreat, before she died,
Forgiveness of her every sin from Heaven.
