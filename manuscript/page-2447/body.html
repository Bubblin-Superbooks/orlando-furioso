The bride's possession with the stranger knight,
Lest he, as undefended, be opprest,
And forfeit so without dispute his right,

Shall here assert a claim to Bradamant,
Or more desert than good Rogero vaunt."</pre><h5>LVIII</h5><pre>She spake this with such anger and disdain,
Many surmised amid the assistant crew,
That, without waiting leave from Charlemagne,
What she had threatened she forthwith would do.

And from Rogero's head the helm withdrew;
And to Marphisa, "For himself to speak,
Behold him here and ready!" cried the Greek.</pre><h5>LIX</h5></div> </div>
