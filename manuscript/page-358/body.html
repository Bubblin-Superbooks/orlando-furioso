And toils, now here, now there, with labour sore:
Oh!  what tormenting grief, to think his eyes
Cannot again the lovely rays explore!
— Lo!  other voice from other quarter cries —
"Hope not on earth to enjoy the blessing more."
At that alarming cry he woke, and found
Himself in tears of bitter sorrow drowned.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXXIV</p></blockquote><pre><code>Not thinking that like images are vain,
When fear, or when desire disturbs our rest,
The thought of her, exposed to shame and pain,
In such a mode upon his fancy pressed,
He, thundering, leaped from bed, and with what chain
And plate behoved, his limbs all over dressed;
Took Brigliadoro from the stall he filled,
Nor any squire attendant's service willed.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
