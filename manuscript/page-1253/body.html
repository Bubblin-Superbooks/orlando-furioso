The foul destroyer of each country round:
Parforce will every standard fly before
That conquering faulchion, or be cast to ground:
Nor, stormed by it, will rampart, fosse, or wall,
Secure the city, they surround, from fall.</p><blockquote><p>XLVII</p></blockquote><p>"Imbued with every generous quality,
Which can in great commander be combined,
â€” Prudence like his who won Thrasymenae
And Trebbia's field, with Caesar's daring mind,
And Alexander's fortune, him I see;
Without which all designs are mist and wind;
Withal, so passing liberal, I in none
Mark his example or his parragon."</p><blockquote><p>XLVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">So Malagigi to his comrades said,
And moved in them desire some name to hear
Of others, who had laid that monster dead,
