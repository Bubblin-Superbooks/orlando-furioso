The new disaster with his very eye.
Hence he the choicest of his meiny steers
Thither, where he the cry and tumult hears.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIX</p></blockquote><p>With many peers and chiefs, who worthiest are,
Summoned about him, Charlemagne is gone:
He bids direct his standards to the square
Whither the paynim had repaired; hears groan
And tumult, spies the horrid tokens there
Of cruelty, sees human members strown.
— No more — Let him return another time,
Who willingly will listen to this rhyme.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
