Took such affection, whom she held so dear,
That she obliged herself with her to stay.
Through all the signs the sun had travelled, ere
The judge had leave to wend his homeward way.
He finally returned; but sore afraid
Through what the astrologer erewhile had said.</p><blockquote><p>CXVII</p></blockquote><p>"Arrived, his first employment is to run
To that astrologer's abode, and crave,
If shame and evil to his wife be done;
Of if she yet her faith and honor save.

Of the seven planets its due station gave;
Then to the judge replied that it had been
Even as he feared, and as it was foreseen.</p><blockquote><p>CXVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"By richest presents tempted to forego
Her faith, a prey was she to other wight.
This to the doctor's heart was such a blow;
