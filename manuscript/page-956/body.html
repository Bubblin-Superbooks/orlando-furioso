In bed should with ten damsels take delight.</pre><h5>LVIII</h5><pre>And if he brings to end the former feat,

Condemned to delve their land or keep their beeves.

Not for himself; who there must stay and wed
Ten wives by him selected for his bed.</pre><h5>LIX</h5><pre class="  ">So strange a custom of the neighbouring strand
