To arm them in this fashion of the west.
Haply this sprung out of their vicinage
And constant commerce with the Franks, possest

Of wretched Christians, heathen hounds profane.</pre><h5>LXXIV</h5><pre>God's worshippers, where they should couch the lance,
For furtherance of his holy faith and true,
Against each other's breast the spear advance,

And Switzers, turn your steps elsewhere , and you,
Ye Germans, worthier empire to acquire;
For that is won for Christ, which you desire.</pre><h5>LXXV</h5></div> </div>
