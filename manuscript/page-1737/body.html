Aid to the leaguered city to convey;
And lo!  burnt, sunk, destroyed, they disappear,
Encountered by the Doria in mid-way.
Behold!  how Fortune light does shift and veer,
So friendly to the Frenchman till this day!
Who slays their host with fever, not with lance;
Nor of a thousand one returns to France.</pre><h5>LVIII</h5><pre>These histories and more the pictures shew,
(For to tell all would ask too long a strain)
In beauteous colours and of different hue;
Since such that hall, it these could well contain.
The painting twice and thrice those guests review,
Nor how to leave them knows the lingering train,
'Twould seem; perusing oft what they behold
Inscribed below the beauteous work in gold.</pre><h5>LIX</h5></div> </div>
