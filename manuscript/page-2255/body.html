Of waters, where I feared, with troubled brow,
To scathe my bark or wander evermore.
But now, methinks â€” yea, now I see the land;
I see the friendly port its arms expand.</p><blockquote><p>II</p></blockquote><p>A burst of joy, like thunder to my ear,
Rumbles along the sea and rends the sky.
I chiming bells, I shrilling trumpets hear,
Confounded with the people's cheerful cry;
And now their forms, that swarm on either pier
Of the thick-crowded harbour, I descry.
All seem rejoiced my task is smoothly done,
And I so long a course have safely run.</p><blockquote><p>III</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">What beauteous dames and sage, here welcome me!
With them what cavaliers the shore adorn!
What friends!  to whom I owe eternity
Of thanks for their delight at my return.
