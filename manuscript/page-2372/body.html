Save to the squire who journeyed with his lord.</pre><h5>XXVIII</h5><pre>Oh!  how she sighs!  how fears the gentle maid,
Hearing Rogero, as it were, was flown!
Oh!  how above all other terrors, weighed
The fear, that to forget her he was gone!
That, seeing Aymon still his wish gainsayed,
And that to wed the damsel hope was none,
He fled, perchance, so hoping to be loosed
From toils wherein he by her love was noosed;</pre><h5>XXIX</h5><pre class="  ">And that with further end the youthful lord
Her from his heart more speedily to chase,
Will rove from realm to realm, till one afford
Some dame, that may his former love efface;
Even, as the proverb says, that in a board
One nail drives out another from its place.
