When she in him, who made the proffer, viewed
The Mantuan cavalier that whilom wooed.</pre><h5>CXV</h5><pre>"The harlot nurse's evil oratory,
The prayer and presence of the suitor lord,
The occasion to acquire that mighty fee,
Which wretched Anselm's absence would afford,
The hope that none would her accuser be,
So vanquish her chaste thoughts, she makes the accord â€”
Accepts the wondrous dog; and, as his pay,
To her leman yields herself a willing prey.</pre><h5>CXVI</h5><pre class="  ">The fruits of love long culled that cavalier
With his lady fair; unto whom the fay
Took such affection, whom she held so dear,
That she obliged herself with her to stay.
