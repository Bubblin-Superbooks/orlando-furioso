In a hundred parts, their cyphered names are dight;
Whose many letters are so many goads,
Which Love has in his bleeding hear-core pight.

That which he credits in his own despite;
And would parforce persuade himself, that rhind
Other Angelica than his had signed.</pre><h5>CIV</h5><pre>"And yet I know these characters," he cried,
"Of which I have so many read and seen;
By her may this Medoro be belied,
And me, she, figured in the name, may mean."

The real truth, did sad Orlando lean
Upon the empty hope, though ill contented,
Which he by self-illusions had fomented.</pre><h5>CV</h5></div> </div>
