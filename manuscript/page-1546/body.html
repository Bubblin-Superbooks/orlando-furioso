<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">By his own love, did not that damsel hide;
Because the wretch discerns not black from white,
And harms where he would help.  A curse betide
The wonder-working ring, and eke the wight
Who gave it to that lady, full or pride!
Since Roland, but for this, would venge the scorn
He and a thousand more from her had borne.</pre><h5>LXXIV</h5><pre>Would that of her Orlando were possest,
And of all women that are above ground!
For one and all are ingrates at the best,
Nor is in all an ounce of goodness found.
But it is meet I let my hearer rest
Ere my strained chords return a faltering sound,
And that he may less tedious deem the rhyme,
Defer my story till another time.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
