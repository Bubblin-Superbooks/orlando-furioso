A cry, not distant far, arrests the peer.
Then thitherward he with those damsels made,
Prompt, if 'twere needed, to bestow his aid.</p><blockquote><p>XXVI</p></blockquote><p>They rode an-end; and louder waxed the sound,
And plainer were the plaintive words they heard:
When in a valley they three women found
Making that plaint, who in strange garb appeared:
For to the navel were those three ungowned,
— Their coats by some uncourteous varlet sheared —
And knowing not how better to disguise
Their shame, they sate on earth, and dared not rise.</p><blockquote><p>XXVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">As Vulcan's son, that sprang (as it is versed)
Out of the dust, without a mother made,
Whom — so Minerva bade — Aglauros nursed
With sovereign care, too bold and curious maid,
Seated in car, by him constructed</p></div> </div>
