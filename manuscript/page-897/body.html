For western countries, taking in her store:
They, with the patron, for themselves and gear,
And horses, make accord; a seaman hoar
Of Luna he: the heavens, on all sides clear,
Vouch many days' fair weather.  From the shore
They loose, with sky serene, and every sail
Of the yare vessel stretched by favouring gale.</pre><h5>CXXXVI</h5><pre>The island of the amorous deity
Breathed upon them an air, in her first port,
Which not alone to man does injury,
But moulders iron, and here life is short;
— A marsh the cause, — and Nature certainly
Wrongs Famagosta, poisoning, in such sort,
That city with Constantia's fen malign,
To all the rest of Cyprus so benign.</pre></div> </div>
