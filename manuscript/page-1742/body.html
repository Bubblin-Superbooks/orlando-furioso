They and their horses, through the livelong night,
Trampling the mire, with chattering teeth, had stood:
But (what well-nigh engendered more despite
— Say not well nigh — more moved the warrior's mood)

Bold Bradamant anew to fight defied,
When of the drawbridge clear they her descried;</pre></div> </div>
