Were standing, overright the Irish shore;
When, speaking thus on that high headland, he
Plunged from a rock amid the watery roar.
I saw him leap, and left him in the sea;
And, hurrying thence, to you the tidings bore.'

And, at the fearful tale, remained half dead.</pre><h5>LX</h5><pre>"O God!  what said, what did she, when alone,
She on her faithful pillow layed her head!
She beat her bosom, and she tore her gown,
And in despite her golden tresses shed;
Repeating often, in bewildered tone,
The last sad words which Ariodantes said; â€”
That the sole source of such despair, and such
Disaster, was that he had seen too much.</pre></div> </div>
