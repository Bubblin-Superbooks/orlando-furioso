And, if fine helmets did their temples press,
His sword would cut as deep, or little less.</pre><h5>XIV</h5><pre>Such good Rogero's force and valour are,
As never now-a-days in warrior dwell;
Nor yet in rampant lion, nor in bear,
Nor (whether home or foreign beast more fell. ) 

Haply with him the earthquake might compare,
Or haply the great devil — not he of hell —
But he who is my lord's, who moves in fire,
And parts heaven, earth, and ocean in his ire.</pre><h5>XV</h5><pre class="  ">At every stroke he never less o'erthrew
Than one, and oftener two, upon the plain;
And four, at once, and even five he slew;
So that a hundred in a thought were slain.
