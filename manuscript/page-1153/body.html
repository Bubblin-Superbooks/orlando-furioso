<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This author vouches (I declare not who)
That hence they had not one day's journey wended,
When Odoric, to all pact, all faith, untrue,
For riddance of the pest to him commended,
About Gabrina's neck a halter threw,
And left her to a neighbouring elm suspended;
And in a year (the place he does not name)
Almonio by the traitor did the same.</p><blockquote><p>XLVI</p></blockquote><p>Zerbino, who the Paladin pursues,
And loath would be to lose the cavalier,
To his Scottish squadron of himself sends news,
Which for its captain well might stand in fear;
Almonio sends, and many matters shews,
Too long at full to be recited here;
Almonio sends, Corebo next; nor stayed
Other with him, besides the royal maid.</p><blockquote><p>XLVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">So mighty is the love Zerbino bore,
Nor less than his</p></div> </div>
