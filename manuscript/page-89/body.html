Or, should her valour in the adventure fail,
Would with the cherished lover share his jail.</pre><h5>LXVI</h5><pre>And did with such excuse that post appay,
He was contented on her will to wait:

Held in such open and such secret hate;
And future trouble to himself foresees,

And oft to blows the rival houses came,
And oft in civil blood their hands embrued.
And hence some treason to this gentle dame
