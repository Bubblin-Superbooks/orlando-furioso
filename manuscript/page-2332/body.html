The Marquis Olivier and King Sobrine,
What shall I do?  such grievous wrong shall I
Endure, or, rather than endure it, die?</pre><h5>LIV</h5><pre>"What shall I do?  her father then pursue,
On whom for vengeance this grave outrage cries?
I heed not that the deed is hard to do,
Or if the attempt in me is weak or wise: â€”
But presuppose that, with his kindred crew
Slain by my hand that unjust elder dies;
This will in nothing further my content;
Nay it will wholly frustrate my intent.</pre><h5>LV</h5><pre class="  ">" `Twas ever my intent, and still 'tis so
To have the love, not hatred, of that fair;
But should I Aymon slay, or bring some woe
By plot or practice, on his house or heir,
