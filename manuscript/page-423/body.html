By echo every where repeated, spread,
"Now â€” now, Rogero, bare the magic shield,
Or in the strife be slain, or basely yield":</pre><h5>L</h5><pre>Thus Logistilla's pilot; and beside,
So saying, seized the pouch, wherein was dight
The buckler, and the covering torn aside,
Exposed to open view the shining light.
The enchanted splendor, flashing far and wide,
So sore offends the adversaries' sight,
They from their vessels drop amazed and blind,
Tumbling from prow before, and poop behind.</pre><h5>LI</h5><pre class="  ">One who stood sentry on the citadel
Descried the navy of the invading dame,
And backwards rang the castle larum-bell,
Whence speedy succours to the haven came.
