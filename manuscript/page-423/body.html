Are left astern, and now descried no more;
Since to shun Friesland they to larboard hawl.
And keep their course more nigh the Scottish shore:
When they are overtaken by a squall,
And drive three days the open sea before:
Upon the third, when now, near eventide,
A barren and unpeopled isle is spied.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XVII</p></blockquote><pre><code>As soon as they were harboured in a hight,
Olympia landed and the board was spread;

Supt, unsuspecting any cause for dread.
Thence, with Bireno, where a tent was pight
In pleasant place, repaired, and went to bed.
The others of their train returned abroad,
And rested in their ship, in haven moored.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XVIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
