Thus, for another, to destroy oneself?</pre><h5>II</h5><pre>Various are love's effects; but from one source
All issue, though they lead a different way.
He is, as 'twere, a forest, where parforce
Who enter its recess go astray;
And here and there pursue their devious course:
In sum, to you I, for conclusion, say;
He who grows old in love, besides all pain
Which waits such passion, well deserves a chain.</pre><h5>III</h5><pre class="  ">One here may well reproach me: "Brother, thou
Seest not thy faults, while thou dost others fit."
â€” I answer that I see mine plain enow,
In this my lucid interval of wit;
And strive and hope withal I shall forego
This dance of folly; but yet cannot quit,
