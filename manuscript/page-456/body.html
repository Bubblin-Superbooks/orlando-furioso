<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h5>CXV</h5><pre>Now here, now there, confused by different throng,
Rogero did his shining arms undo:
Never the task appeared to him so long;
For where he loosed one knot, he fastened two.
But, sir, too long continued is this song,
And haply may as well have wearied you;
So that I shall delay to other time,
When it may better please, my tedious rhyme.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
