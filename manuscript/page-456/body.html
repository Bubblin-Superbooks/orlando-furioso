The thunder on the Earl of Kent's; upon
Pembroke's a griffin; underneath a yoke;
In Essex's, conjoined, two snakes are shown:
By yonder lifted balance is bespoke
The Duke of Suffolk; and Northumbria's Earl
A garland does on azure field unfurl.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXX</p></blockquote><pre><code>"Arundel's Earl is yonder cavalier,
Whose banner bears a foundering bark!  In sight
The next, is Berkeley's noble Marquis; near
Are March and Richmond's Earls: the first on white
Shows a cleft mount; a palm the second peer;
A pine amid the waves the latter knight.
The next of Dorset and Southampton's town,
Are earls; this bears a car, and that a crown.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXXI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
