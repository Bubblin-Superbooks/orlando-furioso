Valiant Astolpho scaled, and now restored
Was the blind sovereign's eyesight as before,
He would that warrior as a god adore.</pre><h5>XXVIII</h5><pre>So that not only those whom he demands
For the Bisertine war, he gives in aid;
But adds a hundred thousand from his bands,
And offer of his royal person made.
Scarce on the open plain embattled stands,
— All foot — the Nubian host, for war arraid.
For few the horses which that region bore;
Of elephants and camels a large store.</pre><h5>XXIX</h5><pre class="  ">The night before the day, when on its road
The Nubian force should march, Astolpho rose,
And his winged hippogryph again bestrode:
Then, hurrying ever south, in fury goes
