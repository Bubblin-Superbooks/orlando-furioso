What way the ship has made, and towards what land.
Thence all to speak their different thoughts, below,
To midships make resort, with chart in hand;

Whose coast makes many patrons weep and sigh."

Their treasons, each with equal dread opprest.</pre><h5>XLVII</h5><pre class="  ">More spitefully the wind on the third day

The fore-mast by the first is borne away,
