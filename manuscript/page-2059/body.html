That he more trouble in your land has bread.</pre><h5>IV</h5><pre>But Trotto, present at this victory,
Afranio, Moro, Albert, Hannibal,
Zerbinat, Bagno, the Ariostos three,
Assured me of the mighty feat withal,
Certified after by that ensignry,
Suspended from the holy temple's wall,
And fifteen galleys at our river-side,
Which with a thousand captive barks I spied.</pre><h5>V</h5><pre class="  ">He that those wrecks and blazing fires discerned,
And such sore slaughter, under different shows,
Which — venging us for hall and palace burned —
While bark remained, raged wide among the foes,
Might also deem how Africk's people mourned,
With Agramant, mid diverse deaths and woes,
