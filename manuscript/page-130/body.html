Brunello he.  Who wears the gift shall bring
To nought all sorceries and magic wiles.
In thefts and cheats Brunello is as well
Instructed, as the sage in charm and spell.</pre><h5>LXX</h5><pre>"Brunello, he so practised and so sly
As now I tell thee, by his king is sent,
That he with aid of mother wit may try,
And of this ring, well proved in like event,
To take Rogero from the castle high;
So has he boasted, by the wizard pent:
And to his lord such promise did impart,
Who has Rogero's presence most at heart.</pre><h5>LXXI</h5><pre class="  ">"That his escape to thee alone may owe,
Not to the king, the youthful cavalier,
How to release Rogero from his foe
