Their wits, some, scowering seas, for merchandise,
Some, that on wealthy lords their hope repose,
And some, befooled by silly sorceries;
These upon pictures, upon jewels those;
These on whatever else they highest prize.
Astrologers' and sophists' wits mid these,
And many a poet's too, Astolpho sees.</pre><h5>LXXXVI</h5><pre class="  ">Since his consent the apostle signified
Who wrote the obscure Apocalypse, his own
He took, and only to his nose applied,
When (it appeared it to its place was gone; ) 

And henceforth, has Sir Turpin certified,
That long time sagely lived king Otho's son;
Till other error (as he says again )
