Who, after wandering long, by date and down,
Here to his grief another courser left,
And lightly went his way, of arms bereft.</pre><h5>LV</h5><pre>Stript of his armour and afoot, did part
That paynim monarch from the bridge of dread;
As Rodomont permitted to depart
Those other knights that in his faith were bred:
But to his camp to wend he had no heart,
For there he was ashamed to show his head:
Since, in such fashion, thither to return
After his boasts, had been too foul a scorn.</pre><h5>LVI</h5><pre class="  ">Yet still with new desire the warrior burned
To seek her, fixed alone in his heart's core;
And such the monarch's chance, he quickly learned
(I cannot tell you who the tidings bore)
