The king yet little seems his foe to exceed;
Who, if he had as tempered plate and chain
As that bold paynim lord, would better speed;
But (for he felt himself ill-armed the knight ) 

Often gave ground, and traversed left and right.</pre><h5>LXXX</h5><pre>Better than good Frontino horse is none
To obey upon a sign the cavalier;
'Twould seem that courser had the sense to shun
Sharp Durindana's fall, now there now here.
Meanwhile elsewhere is horrid battle done
By royal Agramant and Olivier;
Who may be deemed well matched in warlike sleight,
Nor champions differing much in martial might.</pre><h5>LXXXI</h5><pre class="  ">Orlando had left Sobrino (as I said)
