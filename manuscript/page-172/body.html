If she her lover blessed I little heed:
For this my praise the lady well might claim,
If manifest were not that gentle deed.

Grant me but one to guide my steps, and lead
Quickly to where the foul accuser stands,
I trust in God to loose Geneura's bands.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXV</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>"I will not vouch her guiltless in my thought,
In fear to warrant what is false; but I
Boldly maintain, in such an act is nought
For which the damsel should deserve to die;
And ween unjust, or else of wit</pre></div> </div>
