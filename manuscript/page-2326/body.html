<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Alas!  what blemish is so foul to sight
In damsel?  What so ill, as to affy
Myself to husband, reckless of her will,
Which 'tis my duty ever to fulfil?</pre><h5>XLII</h5><pre>"Wo worth the while!  and shall I then to thee
By filial love be forced to be untrue,
O my Rogero, and surrender me
To a new hope, a new love, and a new
Desire; or rather from those ties break free,
From all good children to good parents due;
Observance, reverence cast aside; and measure
My duty by my happiness, my pleasure?</pre><h5>XLIII</h5><pre class="  ">"I know, alas!  what I should do; I know
That which a duteous daughter doth behove;
I know; but what avails it, if not so
My reason moves me as my senses move;
