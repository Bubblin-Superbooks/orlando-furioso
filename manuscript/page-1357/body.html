This maid as that, on him bestow the gain;
And all of those, whom he about her spied,
Forthwith to joust and single fight defied.</pre><h5>LXXII</h5><pre>Vivian and Malagigi (who were dight
In arms, as guard and surety for the rest,)
One and the other champion â€” prompt for fight,
Rose lightly from the herbage which they prest,
Deeming they had to joust with either knight;
But Rodomont, who came not on this quest,
No motion made as he a course would run;
So that they had to tourney but with one.</pre><h5>LXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">Sir Vivian is the first who moves his horse,
With mighty heart, and lays his weapon low;
And he, that Tartar king, renowned for force,
With greater puissance meets the coming foe.
