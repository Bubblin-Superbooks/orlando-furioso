<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Fortune, at length, where caged with Roland are
Ferrau and Sacripant, directs her chase;
Rogero, with Gradasso fierce, and more,
Noosed with strange witcheries by Atlantes hoar.</pre><h5>XXVI</h5><pre>She enters, hidden from the enchanter's eyes,
And by the ring concealed, examines all;
And Roland there, and Sacripant espies,
Intent to seek her vainly through the Hall;
And with her image cheating both, descries
Atlantes old.  The damsel doubts withal
Which of the two to take, and long revolves
This in her doubtful thought, nor well resolves.</pre><h5>XXVII</h5><pre class="  ">She knows not which with her will best accord,
The Count Orlando or Circassia's knight.
As of most powers, her would Rogero ward
In passage perilous, with better might.
