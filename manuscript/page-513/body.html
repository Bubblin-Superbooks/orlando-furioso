The waist more clear than mirror's polished grain,
And members seem of Phidias' turnery,
Or work of better hand and nicer pain.
As well to you of other parts should I
Relate, which she to hide desired in vain.
To sum the beauteous whole, from head to feet,
In her all loveliness is found complete.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXX</p></blockquote><pre><code>And had she in the Idaean glen unveiled
In ancient days before the Phrygian swain,
By how much heavenly Venus had prevailed
I know not, though her rivals strove in vain.
Nor haply had the youth for Sparta sailed,
To violate the hospitable reign;
But said:  "With Menelaus let Helen rest!
No other prize I seek, of this possest";</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
