<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>That night in prison, fettered with a pair
Of heavy letters, is Zerbino chained.
For before yet the skies illuminated are,
The wrongful execution is ordained;
And in the place will he be quartered, where
The deed was done for which he is arraigned.
No other inquest is on this received;
It is enough that so their lord believed.</p><blockquote><p>LII</p></blockquote><p>When, the next morn, Aurora stains with dye
Red, white, and yellow, the clear horizon,
The people rise, to punish ("Death!"  their cry)
Zerbino for the crime he has not done:
They without order him accompany,
A lawless multitude, some ride, some run.
I' the midst the Scottish prince, with drooping head,
Is, bound upon a little hackney, led.</p><blockquote><p>LIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But HE who with the innocent oft sides,
Nor those abandons who make him their stay,
For prince Zerbino</p></div> </div>
