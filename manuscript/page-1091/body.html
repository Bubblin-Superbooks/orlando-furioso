Would readily assist him in his need.
— His only wish, (the cavalier replied,)
Was, he might be from ill Gabrina freed,
Ere him some mighty mischief should betide,

For ill the simple truth admits reply.</pre><h5>LXX</h5><pre>Zerbino thence, upon the promised way,
With the old woman in his escort, went,
And inly cursed her all the livelong day,

Who was instructed in her evil bent,
He — if before he had her at despite —
So loathed her, she was poison to his sight.</pre></div> </div>
