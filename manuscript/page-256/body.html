<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h5>LXXII</h5><pre>Upon the sill and through the columns there,
Ran young and wanton girls, in frolic sport;
Who haply yet would have appeared more fair,
Had they observed a woman's fitting port.
All are arrayed in green, and garlands wear
Of the fresh leaf.  Him these in courteous sort,
With many proffers and fair mien entice,
And welcome to this opening Paradise:</pre><h5>LXXIII</h5><pre>For so with reason I this place may call,
Where, it is my belief, that Love had birth;
Where life is spent in festive game and ball,
And still the passing moments fleet in mirth.
Here hoary-headed Thought ne'er comes at all,
Nor finds a place in any bosom.  Dearth,
Nor yet Discomfort, never enter here,
Where Plenty fills her horn throughout the year.</pre></div> </div>
