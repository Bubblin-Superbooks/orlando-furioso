And try we if all women are as weak;
And if the wives of others can be won
To do what others by our own have done.</pre><h5>XLVI</h5><pre>" `Both fair and youthful, measured by this scale,

Nor will I that we homeward more return,
Ere the chief spoils we from a thousand earn.</pre><h5>XLVII</h5><pre class="  ">" `Long absence, seeing with a distant part,
Converse with different women, oft allay,
