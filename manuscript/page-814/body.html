Less than an hour sufficed to finish all.
But Norandine, the pastime to delay,
And to continue it till even-fall,
Descending from his place, bade clear the way;
And the huge squad divided, at his call,
Into two troops, whom, ranked by blood and might,
The monarch formed, and marched for other fight.</pre><h5>CVI</h5><pre>Sir Gryphon, during this, had made return
Homeward, with anger and with fury stung;

Martano now employs his lying tongue;
And she, the false and cunning courtezan,
Assists him in his scheme as best she can.</pre><h5>CVII</h5></div> </div>
