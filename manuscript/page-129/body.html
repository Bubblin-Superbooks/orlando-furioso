Their brows with shame and sorrow overcast,
With downward look, and gait subdued and slow:
I saw the brothers shun them as they passed."
Melissa heard the dame with signs of woe,
And thus, with streaming eyes, exclaim'd at last:
"Ah! luckless youths, with vain illusions fed,
Whither by wicked men's bad counsel led!</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXII</p></blockquote><pre><code>"O, worthy seed of Hercules the good,
Let not their guilt beyond thy love prevail;
Alas!  the wretched pair are of thy blood,
So many prevailing pity turn the scale!"
And in a sad and softer tone pursued,
"I will not further press the painful tale.
Chew on fair fancy's food: Nor deem unmeet
I will not with a bitter chase the sweet.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
