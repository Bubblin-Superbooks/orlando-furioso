Pursued his path along the sunny shore,
Were irksome and displeasing company,
Beneath the shadow of a turret hoar,
Which rose beside the beach, amid the sea,
He found three ladies of Alcina's court,
As such distinguished by their dress and port.</p><blockquote><p>XXXVII</p></blockquote><p>Reclined on Alexandrian carpets rare

About them various wines in vessels were,
And every sort of comfit nicely dight;
Fast by, and sporting with the ripple there,
Lay, waiting on their needs, a pinnace light,
Until a breeze should fill her sail anew:
For then no breath upon the waters blew.</p><blockquote><p>XXXVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">They, who beheld along the shifting sand
Rogero wend, upon his way intent,
And saw thirst figured on</p></div> </div>
