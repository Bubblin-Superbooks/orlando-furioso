<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">extended, said:
"What, if I suddenly thy purpose balk,
And thou find no defence against this hawk?"</p><blockquote><p>VI</p></blockquote><p>Then flies his bird, who works so well his wing,
Rabican cannot distance him in flight:
The falconer from his back to ground did spring,
And freed him from the bit which held him tight;
Who seemed an arrow parted from the string,
And terrible to foe, with kick and bite;
While with such haste behind the servant came,
He sped as moved by wind, or rather flame.</p><blockquote><p>VII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Nor will the falconer's dog appear more slow;
But hunts Rogero's courser, as in chace
Of timid hare the pard is wont to go.
Not to stand fast the warrior deems disgrace,
And turns towards the swiftly-footed foe,
Whom he sees wield a riding-wand, place
Of other arms, to make his dog obey.
Rogero scorns his faulchion</p></div> </div>
