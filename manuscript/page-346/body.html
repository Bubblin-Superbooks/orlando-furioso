Confiding to his son the wedding's care,
To meet Bireno's squadron puts to sea,
And (so chance willed burns, sinks, or routs them there, )</p><p>Leading him off into captivity; â€”
But none to us as yet the tidings bear.
This while I to the amorous youth am wed,
Who, when the sun sought his, would seek my bed.</p><blockquote><p>XLI</p></blockquote><p>"Behind the curtains, I had hid the tried
And faithful follower, of whom I said,
Who moved not till the bridegroom he descried,
Yet waited not till he in bed was laid:
But raised a hatchet, and so well applied
Behind the stripling's head the ponderous blade,
Of speech and life it reft him; I, who note
The deed, leap lightly up and cut his throat.</p><blockquote><p>XLII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
