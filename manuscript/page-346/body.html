The island's lonely bank, a gallery creeps;
Where, amid stubs upon the grassy shore,
Angelica, unhappy damsel, sleeps.
To wood and water there the sailor's moor,
And from the bark, for this, a party leaps;
And there that matchless flower of earthly charms
Discovers in the holy father's arms.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXII</p></blockquote><pre><code>Oh!  prize too dear, oh!  too illustrious prey!
To glut so barbarous and so base a foe!
Oh!  cruel Fortune!  who believed thy sway
Was of such passing power in things below?
That thou shouldst make a hideous monster's prey
The beauty, for which Agrican did glow,
Brought with half Scythia's people from the gates
Of Caucasus, in Ind, to find their fates.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
