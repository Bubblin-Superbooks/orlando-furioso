The truth with vantage on his side, begun )</p><p>The fight, who brought a monster to the fray,
Found only in those parts, and wont to won
Ashore or under water, and to prey,
For food, on human bodies; feeding on
Poor mariners and travelling men, who fare,
Of the impending danger, unaware.</p><blockquote><p>LXIX</p></blockquote><p>The monster, slaughtered by the brethren two,
Upon the sand beside the haven lies;
And hence no wrong they to Orrilo do,
Assailing him together in this guise.
Him they dismembered often and not slew:
Now he, — because dismembered, — ever dies;
For he replaces leg or hand like wax,
Which the good faulchion from his body hacks.</p><blockquote><p>LXX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
