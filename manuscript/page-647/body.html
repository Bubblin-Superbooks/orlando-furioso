Nor can contain his furious spirit more.</pre><h5>CIX</h5><pre>As swarming to assail the pastoral bowl,
With sound of stridulous wing, through summer sky,
Or relics of a feast, their luscious dole,
Repair the ready numbers of the fly;
As starlings to the vineyard's crimsoning pole
With the ripe clusters charged, â€” heaven's concave high
Filling, as they advanced, with noise and shout,
Fast hurried to the storm the Moorish rout.</pre><h5>CX</h5><pre class="  ">Upon their walls the Christians in array,
With lance, sword, axe, and wild-fire tost,
The assaulted city guard without dismay,
And little reck the proud barbarian's boast:
Nor when death snatches this or that away,
Does any one in fear refuse his post.
