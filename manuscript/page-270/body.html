All this fair garden, puts in disarray

Lately with brutal rage assaulted you,
Many her sons, the whole her followers call,
As greedy and inhospitable all."</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXX</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>"For you not only her I would assail,

I swear not, I, in warlike cuirass pent;
But to afford my aid to others</pre></div> </div>
