He still had censured, in his wiser lore,
If by his brother Aquilant accurst,
Her Gryphon, in his partial love, excuses,
For mostly self-conceit our sense abuses.</p><blockquote><p>CV</p></blockquote><p>It therefore is his purpose, without say
To Aquilant, alone to take the quest

Who had borne off his heart-core from his breast:
To find him, who had made the dame his prey,
And take such vengeance of him, ere he rest,
As shall for aye be told.  My next will tell
How he effected this, and what befell.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
