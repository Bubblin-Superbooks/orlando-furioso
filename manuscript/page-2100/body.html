How perfect was its first perfume and pure.</pre><h5>II</h5><pre>The drink that to his cost good Icarus drew
Of yore his sun-burned sicklemen to cheer,
And which ('tis said lured Celts and Boi through ) 

Our Alpine hills, untouched by toil whilere,
Well shows that cordial was the draught, when new;
Since it preserves its virtue through the year.
The tree to which its wintry foliage cleaves,
Well shows that verdant were its spring tide leaves.</pre><h5>III</h5><pre class="  ">The famous lineage, for so many years
Of courtesy the great and lasting light,
Which ever, brightening as it burns, appears
To shine and flame more clearly to the sight,
Well proves the sire of Este's noble peers
