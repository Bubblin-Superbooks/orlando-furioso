To the oracle, demanding counsel, fly,
Which to the suppliant's prayer made this reply:</p><blockquote><p>LVI</p></blockquote><p>`That it behoved them find a damsel, who
A form as beauteous as that other wore,
To be to Proteus offered up, in lieu
Of the fair lady, slain upon the shore:
He, if he deems her an atonement due,
Will keep the damsel, not disturb them more:
If not, another they must still present,
And so, till they the deity content.'</p><blockquote><p>LVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And this it was the cruel usage bred;
That of the damsels held most fair of face,
To Proteus every day should one be led.
Till one should in the Godhead's sight find grace.
The first and all those others slain, who fed,
All a devouring orc, that kept his place
Beside the port, what time into the main
The remnant of the herd</p></div> </div>
