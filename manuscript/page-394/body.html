Tutored by her, than bath and costly fare,
Song, dance, and perfumes; as how fashioned best,
Your thoughts may tower more high than hawks in air;
And how some of the glory of the blest
You here may in the mortal body share."
So speaking, and yet distant from the shore,
To the safe bank approached the pilot hoar.</p><blockquote><p>XLVIII</p></blockquote><p>When he beholds forth-issuing from the strand,
A fleet of ships, which all towards him steer.
With these came wronged Alcina, with a band
Of many vassals, gathered far and near;
To risk the ruin of herself and land,
Or repossess the thing she held so dear.
Love, no light cause, incites the dame aggrieved,
Nor less the bitter injury received.</p><blockquote><p>XLIX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
