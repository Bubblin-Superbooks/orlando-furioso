Their goodly steeds they quit, there well bested,
Put off their arms, and in a garden sweet
Discern the ready supper duly laid

Fast-tethered by a strong and weighty chain
To a tough oak, whose ancient trunk they ween

Lest he by night get loose, and so the train
Assault and haply harm; while careless they
Without a guard and unsuspecting lay.</p><blockquote><p>LXXVIII</p></blockquote><p>At the abundant and most sumptuous board,
