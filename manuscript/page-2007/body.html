The victory with Count Orlando lies;
But good Rinaldo and Bradamant at heart,
(One for Angelica, the other sighs
For young Rogero suffer cruel smart. )</p><p>Him that in chase of the Indian damsel hies
Disdain preserves; from thence does he depart
Towards Italy, and is with courteous cheer
And welcome guested by a cavalier.</p><blockquote><p>I</p></blockquote><p>What bit, what iron curb is to be found,
Or (could it be what adamantine rein, )</p></div> </div>
