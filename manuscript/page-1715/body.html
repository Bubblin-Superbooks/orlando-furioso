<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">strife,
Deeming Rogero lost, detested life.</p><blockquote><p>XXXIX</p></blockquote><p>"O loving damsel (she made answer), I
Offer mine aid, for such as 'tis, to do
The hard and dread adventure, passing by
Causes beside that move me, most that you
A matter of your lover testify,
Which I, in sooth, hear warranted of few;
That he is constant; for i'faith I swear,
I well believed all lovers perjured were."</p><blockquote><p>XL</p></blockquote><p>With these last words a sigh that damsel drew,
A sigh which issued from her heart; then said:
"Go we"; and, with the following sun, those two
At the deep stream arrived and bridge of dread:
— Seen of the guard, that on his bugle blew
A warning blast, when strangers thither sped —
The pagan arms him, girds his goodly brand,
And takes upon the bridge his wonted stand;</p><blockquote><p>XLI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
