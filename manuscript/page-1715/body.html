More than a hundred thousand warriors trace;
See Benevento's duke the monarch stay,
Whose thinner files his hostile army face.
Lo!  these who feign retreat an ambush lay.
Lo!  where through danger, havoc, and disgrace,
The Franks, who to the Lombard wine-fat hie,
Drugged by the bait, like poisoned mullets die.</pre><h5>XV</h5><pre class="  ">"Where Childibert the boundary hills has crost,
Heading what bands of France and captains, see;
