Is held in such esteem, the pride of Spain?
So praised by Malagigi, that him few

Through the hot noontide, and fine carpets prest,

Might be more tranquil, watched with armour on;
When unaccompanied they saw a dame,
Who quickly towards their place of shelter came;</p><blockquote><p>LV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Hippalca she; from whom was torn away
