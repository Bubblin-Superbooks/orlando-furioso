The issue of the fight their cavalier
Should wage against Gradasso, one to one.
Much force, much daring, and much skill appear
In that fierce king; and since of Milo's son
The goodly sword was to his girdle tied,
All cheeks looked pale upon Rinaldo's side;</pre><h5>CVIII</h5><pre>And Malagigi, more than all the rest,
Sore doubted the event which would ensue,

To disappoint the destined fight anew;
But fears if he that deadly strife arrest,
Rinaldo's utter enmity to rue,
Yet wroth with him upon that other score,
When he conveyed the warrior from the shore.</pre><h5>CIX</h5><pre class="  ">Let others nourish idle grief and fears!
