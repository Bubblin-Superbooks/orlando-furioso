Laments, and sighs, and groans in his despair.
Of his good horn remembers him the peer,
Whose clangours helpful aye in peril are,
And deems his bugle were the fittest mean
To free the monarch from those birds unclean;</p><blockquote><p>CXXIV</p></blockquote><p>And first to fill their ears, to king and train,
With melted wax, Astolpho gives command;

May not in panic terror fly the land.

Grasps the enchanted bugle in his hand;
And to the sewer next signs to have the board
Anew with hospitable victual stored.</p><blockquote><p>CXXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The meats he to an open galley bears,
And other banquet spreads on other ground.
Behold, as wont, the harpy-squad appears;
Astolpho quickly lifts the bugle's</p></div> </div>
