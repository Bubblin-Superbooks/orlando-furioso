He deems — and truly deems — he hears his bride;
Whose voice the youth remembers in such wise,
That mid a thousand would he recognize.</pre><h5>XXXVI</h5><pre>Her further meaning well did he divine,
Weening that him she in that speech would blame,
For having broke their pact; and — with design,
The occasion of his failure to proclaim, —
Of his desire for parley made a sign:
But she, with vizor closed, already came,
Raging and grieved, intent, with vengeful hand,
To fling the youth; nor haply upon sand.</pre><h5>XXXVII</h5><pre class="  ">Rogero, when he saw her so offended,
Fixed himself firmly in his arms and seat,
He rests his lance, but holds the stave suspended,
So that it shall not harm her when they meet,
