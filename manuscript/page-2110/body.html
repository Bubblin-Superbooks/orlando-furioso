Springs upward to the surface from below;
And little distant sees that rock, in vain
Eschewed by him and his attendant train.</pre><h5>XXII</h5><pre>Himself with hands and feet the warrior rows,
Hoping by force thereof to win the shore;
Breast boldly the importunate flood, and blows
With his unwearied breath the foam before.
Waxing meanwhile, the troubled water rose,
And from the rock the abandoned vessel bore;
Quitted of those unhappy men, who die
(So curst their lot the death from which they fly. )</pre><h5>XXIII</h5><pre class="  ">Alas!  for man's deceitful thoughts and blind!
The ship escaped from wreck, where hope was none;
When master and when men their charge resigned,
And let the vessel without guidance run.
