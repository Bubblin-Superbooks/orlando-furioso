Which Love's own hand had tinged with native red;
And those two stars of pure transparency,
With which he in Love's toils his fancy fed:
Of those bright eyes, and that bright face, I say,
Which from his breast had torn his heart away.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXXI</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>He with the fullest pleasure overflows,
