He after mighty plaint and mighty woe
Resolved anew to eastern realms to go.</pre><h5>XLII</h5><pre>Licence he asks of Pepin's royal son,
Upon the ground, since with his courser dear
To Sericane is King Gradasso gone,
Against the use of gallant cavalier,
Him honour moves the selfsame course to run,
