<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre>At length the supper, which had long been dight,
Nor yet was touched, enjoys each hungry guest;
Nor any further news of errant knight
Them, seated at the festive board, molest;
All, saving Bradamant, enjoy, whose sprite,
As wont, is still afflicted and opprest.
For that suspicious fear, that doubt unjust,
Which racked her bosom, marred the damsel's gust.</pre><h5>CX</h5><pre>The supper done — brought sooner to a close
Haply from their desire to feast their eyes —
First of the set, Duke Aymon's daughter rose,
And next the courier maid is seen to rise.
With that the warder signs to one, that goes
And many torches fires in nimble wise;
Whose light on storied wall and ceiling fell.</pre><blockquote><p>Canto tell.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
