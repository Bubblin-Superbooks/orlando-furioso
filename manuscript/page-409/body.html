Love with eternal knot had linked the fair,
The empire of herself and her domain
Conferred: He, called away by other care,
Left in the cousin's guardian care this while
His fortresses, and all the subject isle.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXXVII</p></blockquote><pre><code>Since he to visit Zealand's duchy planned,

A pledge, he rated highly, had in hand,
Which seemed of fair success the warranty,
The daughter of the king: who here forsaken,
With many others had been prisoner taken.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXXVIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
