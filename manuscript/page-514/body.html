No help, that thou compassionate my sorrow.</p><blockquote><p>VI</p></blockquote><p>"My father in his city of Bayonne,
(To-day will be twelve months a tourney dight; )</p><p>Hence, led by spreading rumour to our town,
To joust, from different lands came many a knight;
Mid these (was it his manifest renown,
Or was it love which so deceived my sight)
Praise in my eyes alone Zerbino won,
Who was the mighty king of Scotland's son.</p><blockquote><p>VII</p></blockquote><p>"When him I after in the field espied,
Performing wondrous feats of chivalry,
I was surprised by Love, ere I descried
That freedom in my Love, so rash a guide,
I lay this unction to my phantasy,
That no unseemly place my heart possest,
Fixed on the worthiest in the world and best.</p><blockquote><p>VIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
