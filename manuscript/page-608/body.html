A thousand years before, he made his own.
And finished that adventure, strange and fell;
A story which breeds terror but to tell.</pre><h5>XXXII</h5><pre>When the squire told his news amid that show
Of troops, was present Agrican's bold son,
Who raised his daring face, resolved to go
And find the warrior who the deed had done;
But the design he hatched, forebore to show;
As making small account of any one,
Or fearing lest, should he reveal his thought,
The quest by other champion might be sought.</pre><h5>XXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">He of the squire demanded what the vest
And bearings, which the valiant stranger wore;
Who answered that he went without a crest,
And sable shield and sable surcoat bore.
