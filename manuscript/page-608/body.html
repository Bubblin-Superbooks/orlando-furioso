Heads fly and arms; and to the ditch a flood
Runs streaming from the wall of crimson blood.</p><blockquote><p>CXXII</p></blockquote><p>He drops the shield; and with two-handed sway
Wielding his sword, duke Arnulph he offends.

Cleft downwards, a full palm from neck and head.</p><blockquote><p>CXXIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">At one back-stroke sir Spineloccio true,

Make the wide-circling blow so fully tell.
The first half Flemings were, the residue
Are Normans, who the list of slaughter swell.
