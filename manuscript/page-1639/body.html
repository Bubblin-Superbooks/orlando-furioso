Those whom the valiant Sansonet o'erthrew,
And those that in their flight were drowned in Seine,
He who would count, might count as well what flowers
Zephyr and Flora shed, mid April-showers.</pre><h5>LXXXVI</h5><pre>Here one conjectures Malagigi bore
A part in the alarum of that night:
Not that he stained the mead with paynim gore,
Nor splintered heads; but that the wizard wight,
Infernal angels, by his magic lore,
Called from Tartarean caverns into light;
Whose many spears and banners waving wide
Two kingdoms such as France had scarce supplied.</pre><h5>LXXXVII</h5><pre class="  ">And with them such sonorous metal brayed,
So many drums and martial noises sounded;
So many steeds in that encounter neighed;
