Felt himself but all over with desire
To snatch the unhappy stripling from the fire.</pre><h5>XLIV</h5><pre>And to the maid, whose troubled face apears
Bathed with a briny flood, "Why wait we? â€” need
Is here of speedy succour, not of tears.
Do you but where the youth is prisoned lead;
Him from a thousand swords, a thousand spears,
We vow to save; so it be done with speed.
But haste you, lest too tardy be our aid,
And he be burnt, which succour is delayed."</pre><h5>XLV</h5><pre class="  ">The haughty semblance and the lofty say
Of these, who with such wondrous daring glowed,
That hope, which long had ceased to be her stay,
Again upon the grieving dame bestowed:
But, for she less the distance of the way
