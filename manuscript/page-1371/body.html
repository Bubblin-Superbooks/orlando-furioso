Of little value, if it were exprest
By page or other — save his embassy
He did himself; his brother he addrest;

And there at the first inn set-up your rest;

But trust to overtake you by the way.</p><blockquote><p>XX</p></blockquote><p>" `No other but myself my need could do.

And when that cavalier the stream was through,
The rising sun 'gan chase the dusky rack.
At home he lighted, sought his bed, and found
The consort he had quitted sleeping sound.</p><blockquote><p>XXI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
