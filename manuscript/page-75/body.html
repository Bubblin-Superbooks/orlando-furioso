When, as we journey by Rhone's current, I
A rider on a winged courser spy.</pre><h5>XXXVIII</h5><pre>"The robber, whether he were man or shade,
Or goblin damned to everlasting woe,

Sank in a thought and rose; and soaring, laid
Hands on his prize, and snatched her from below.
So quick the rape, that all appeared a dream,
Until I heard in air the damsel's scream.</pre><h5>XXXIX</h5><pre class="  ">"The ravening kite so swoops and plunders, when
Hovering above the shelterd yard, she spies
A helpless chicken near unwatchful hen,
Who vainly dins the thief with after cries.
I cannot reach the mountain-robber's den,
