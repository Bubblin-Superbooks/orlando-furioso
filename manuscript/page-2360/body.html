<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Both throned, when overblown was their mischance,
One king of Hungary, one king of France.</pre><h5>IV</h5><pre>'Tis plain to sight, through instances that fill
The page of ancient and of modern story,
That ill succeeds to good, and good to ill;
That glory ends in shame, and shame in glory;
And that man should not trust, deluded still,
In riches, realm, or field of battle, gory
With hostile blood, nor yet despair, for spurns
Of Fortune; since her wheel for ever turns.</pre><h5>V</h5><pre class="  ">Through that fair victory, when overthrown
Were Leo and his royal sire, the knight
Who won that battle to such trust is grown,
In his good fortune and his peerless might,
He, without following, without aid, alone
(So is he prompted by his daring sprite)
