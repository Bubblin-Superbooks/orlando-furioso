Through eyes and tongue, in tears and in lament.</p><blockquote><p>XL</p></blockquote><p>"Fortune what more remains, that thou on me
Shouldst not now satiate thy revengeful thirst?
What more (she said can I bestow on thee )</p><p>Than, what thou seekest not, this life accurst?
Thou wast in haste to snatch me from the sea,
Where I had ended its sad days, immersed;
Because to torture me with further ill
Before I die, is yet thy cruel will.</p><blockquote><p>XLI</p></blockquote><p>"But what worse torment yet remains in store
Beyond, I am unable to descry:
By thee from my fair throne, which nevermore
I hope to repossess, compelled to fly;
I, what is worse, my honour lost deplore;
For if I sinned not in effect, yet I
Give matter by my wanderings to be stung
For wantonness of every carping tongue.</p><blockquote><p>XLII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
