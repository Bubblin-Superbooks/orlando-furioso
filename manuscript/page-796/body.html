That youth whereon your hopes were wont to feed,
And suffer not that, scattered by the brand,
To Africa be lost our noble seed.
Save you united go, be sure the land
Is shut against you, wheresoe'er you speed.
Too high a wall to climb is mountain-steep,
The yawning sea a ditch too wide to leap.</p><blockquote><p>LI</p></blockquote><p>"Far better 'tis to perish than to be
Torn by these dogs, or lie at their control.
Since vain is every other remedy,
Wait, friends, for love of Heaven, the advancing shoal:
They are not gifted with more lives than we;
Have but one pair of hands, have but one soul."
So saying, the bold youth, amid the crew
Of enemies, the Earl of Huntley slew.</p><blockquote><p>LII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Almontes' memory, through the Moorish</p></div> </div>
