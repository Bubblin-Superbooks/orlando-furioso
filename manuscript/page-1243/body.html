Than the sharp goads which on their heels they wore.
Happy was he with courser well bested!
By trot or amble they set little store;
And he who had no steed, here learned, dismayed,
How wretched is the poor foot-soldier's trade.</p><blockquote><p>XXVI</p></blockquote><p>The conqueror's prize remained both field and prey;

The four united each captive cavalier;
Nor were less diligent to free from chains
The prisoned pages, and unload the wains.</p><blockquote><p>XXVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Besides good quantity of silver fine,
