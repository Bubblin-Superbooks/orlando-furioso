With Sansonnetto and the English knight,
So supplicate Marphisa, she her brand
Puts up, and terminates the cruel fight;
And to the monarch next, amid his brand,
Cries, proudly, "Sir, I know not by what right
Thou wouldst this armour, not thine own, present
To him who conquers in thy tournament.</pre><h5>CXXVIII</h5><pre>"Mine are these arms, which I, upon a day,
Left on the road which leads from Armeny,
Because, parforce a-foot, I sought to stay
A robber, who had sore offended me.
The truth of this my ensign may display.
Which here is seen, if it be known to thee."
With that she on the plate which sheathed the breast
(Cleft in three places showed a crown imprest. )</pre></div> </div>
