Upon that ancient woman, figuring
Like monkey, rather say, like grandam ape.
From her the Saracen designs to wring
The rein, and does the deed: upon the rape
Of the crone's bridle, he, with angry cry,
Threatens and scares her horse, and makes him fly.</p><blockquote><p>XCV</p></blockquote><p>He flies and hurries through the forest gray

By hill and dale, by straight and crooked way,
By fosse and cliff, at hazard, there and here.

Of her, that I should leave Anglantes' peer;
Who, from annoyance of a foe released,
The broken saddle at his ease re-pieced.</p><blockquote><p>XCVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">He mounts his horse, and watches long, before
Departing, if the foe will re-appear;
