Her to that cruel island had conveyed
From where she in as much felicity
Was with her consort left as could be said:
"I know not (cried the weeping dame if I ) 

Have thanks to render thee for death delayed,
Or should lament me that, through means of thee,
This day did not my woes concluded see.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LVII</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>"I have to thank thee that from death, too dread
And monstrous, thy good arm deliverance gave;
Which would have been too monstrous, had I fed
The beast, and in his belly found a grave:
But cannot thank thee that I am not dead,
Since death alone can me from misery save,
Well shall I thank thee for that wished</pre></div> </div>
