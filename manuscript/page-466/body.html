Thus painfully with griding fetters bound?"
At this she cannot choose but show like grain,
Of crimson spreading on an ivory ground;
Knowing those secret beauties are espied,
Which, howsoever lovely, shame would hide;</code></pre><blockquote><p>XCIX</p></blockquote><pre><code>And gladly with her hands her face would hood,
Were they not fastened to the rugged stone:
But with her tears (for this at least she could)
Bedewed it, and essayed to hold it down.
Sobbing some while the lovely damsel stood;
Then loosed her tongue and spake in feeble tone;
But ended not; arrested in mid-word,
By a loud noise which in the sea was heard.</code></pre><blockquote><p>C</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>Lo!  and behold!  the unmeasured-beast</pre></div> </div>
