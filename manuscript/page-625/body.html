And thither I return, where paynims stun
Fair France with hosile din and angry cries,
About the tent, wherein Troyano's son
They holy empire in his wrath defies,
And boastful Rodomont, with vengeful doom,
Gives Paris to the flames, and levels Rome.</pre><h5>LXVI</h5><pre>Tidings had reached the Moorish sovereign's ear
That the English had already passed the sea;
And he bade Garbo's aged king appear,
Marsilius, and his heads of chivalry:
Who all advised the monarch to prepare
For the assault of Paris.  They may be
Assured they in the storm will never thrive,
Unless 'tis made before the aids arrive.</pre><h5>LXVII</h5><pre class="  ">Innumerable ladders for the scale
