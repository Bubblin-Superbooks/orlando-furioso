Of human kind they see; and only there
Find good Frontino, with the trenchant sword
And gallant armour of his youthful lord;</pre><h5>XXVI</h5><pre>Who was so hurried in his hasty flight
He had not even time to take his sword;
To Orlando known; which, Balisardo hight,
Was his erewhile; the tale's upon record,
And ye have read it all, as well I wite;
How Falerina lost it to that lord,
When waste as well her beauteous bowers he laid;
And how from him Brunello stole the blade;</pre><h5>XXVII</h5><pre class="  ">And how beneath Carena, on the plain
Brunello on Rogero this bestowed.
How matchless was that faulchion's edge and grain,
To him experience had already showed;
