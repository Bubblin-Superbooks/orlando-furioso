The tower and tomb, the bridge, scarce finished, stood:
Here — save his casque was open — Ulien's son
Steeled cap-a-pee, stood ready armed for fight,
When to the bridge approached Anglantes' knight.</p><blockquote><p>XLI</p></blockquote><p>Orlando running thus his wild career,
The barrier tops, and o'er the bridge would fly,
But sullen Rodomont, with troubled cheer,
Afoot, as he that tower is standing nigh,
For he disdains to brandish sword or spear,
Shouts to him from afar with threatening cry,
"Halt!  thou intrusive churl and indiscreet,
Rash, meddling, saucy villain, stay thy feet!</p><blockquote><p>XLII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Only for lord and cavalier was made,
And not for thee, dull slave, that bridge was meant."
To this no heed insane Orlando paid,
But, fixt upon his purpose,</p></div> </div>
