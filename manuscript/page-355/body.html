I kept untouched, alas!  now plucked and waste?</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXVIII</p></blockquote><pre><code>"If this fair flower be plucked, oh, misery!  oh,
Despair!  what more is left me but to die?
Almighty God, with every other woe
Rather than this, thy wretched suppliant try.
If this be true, these hands the fatal blow
Shall deal, and doom me to eternity."
Mixing his plaint with bitter tears and sighs,
So to himself the grieved Orlando cries.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXIX</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>Already every where, with due repose,
Creatures restored their weary spirits; laid
These upon stones and upon feathers those,
Or greensward, in the beech or myrtle's shade:
But scarcely did thine eyes, Orlando</pre></div> </div>
