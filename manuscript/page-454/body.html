Longer the monster's rugged scale in vain.
"For heaven's sake turn and loose me" (did she say,
Still weeping "ere the orc awake again. ) 

Bear me with thee, and drown me in mid-way.
Let me not this foul monster's food remain."
By her just plaint Rogero moved, forebore,
Untied the maid, and raised her from the shore.</pre><h5>CXII</h5><pre>Upon the beach the courser plants his feet,
And goaded by the rowel, towers in air,
And gallops with Rogero in mid seat,
While on the croup behind him sate the fair;
Who of his banquet so the monster cheat;
For him too delicate and dainty fare.
Rogero turns and with thick kisses plies
The lady's snowy breast and sparkling eyes.</pre></div> </div>
