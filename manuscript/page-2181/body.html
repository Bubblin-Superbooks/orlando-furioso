That best resists the griding tool, may break:
But, save the form it once hath taken, none

Albeit a thousand times the knight had died:
But, when most clear of the tempestuous strife,
In friendly port these hopes appeared to ride,
These hopes a foul and furious wind anew
Far from the sheltering land to seaward blew.</p><blockquote><p>LXVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In that the gentle Bradamant, who fain
