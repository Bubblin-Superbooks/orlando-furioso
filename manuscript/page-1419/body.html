And when and where and how, that faulchion bright;
And Mandricardo said that he had done
Fierce battle for that sword with Brava's knight;
Who feigned himself of sober sense foregone,
Hoping that so he should conceal his fright:
— "For I on him would ceaseless war have made,"
(He added "while he kept the goodly blade." )</pre><h5>LVII</h5><pre class="  ">Saying the Count, in yielding to his foe
That sword, the Beavers' known device had tried;
Who. followed closely by the hunter, know
Their fell pursuer covers nought beside.
Ere he had heard him out, — "Nor I forego
That sword to thee nor any one," (replied
Gradasso, fierce, "well earned by me, at cost )
