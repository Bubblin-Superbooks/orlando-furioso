Than was the love he lately bore the maid;
For he too foul, and full of cruelty,
Esteemed the deed, although for him essayed;
And, hearing after, in her jeopardy,
That none appeared to lend the damsel aid,
Because so puissant was Lurcanio's might,
All dreaded an encounter with the knight,</p><blockquote><p>IX</p></blockquote><p>And that who well the youthful champion knew,
Believed he was so wary and discreet,
That, had what he related been untrue,
He never would have risqued so rash a feat,
— For this the greater part the fight eschew,
Fearing in wrongful cause the knight to meet —
Ariodantes (long his doubts are weighed)
Will meet his brother in Geneura's aid.</p><blockquote><p>X</p></blockquote><p>"Alas! (he said I cannot bear to see )</p></div> </div>
