She on her faithful pillow layed her head!
She beat her bosom, and she tore her gown,
And in despite her golden tresses shed;
Repeating often, in bewildered tone,
The last sad words which Ariodantes said; â€”
That the sole source of such despair, and such
Disaster, was that he had seen too much.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXI</p></blockquote><pre><code>"Wide was the rumour scattered that the peer
Had slain himself for grief; nor was the cry
By courtly dame, or courtly cavalier,
Or by the monarch, heard with tearless eye.
But, above all the rest, his brother dear
Was whelmed with sorrow of so deep a dye,
That, bent to follow him, he well nigh turned
His hand against himself, like him he mourned.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
