Had taxed too hardly in his long career,
â€” As well he for his ease embarked the steed,
As to pursue his way with better speed.</pre><h5>LXXXVII</h5><pre>He straight makes launch the vessel from the marge,
And bids put forth the oars from either side:
Nor big nor deeply laden, she, at large,
Descends the Saone, transported by the tide.
Care never quits him, though the shifting barge
The king ascend, or nimble horse bestride:
This he encounters aye on prow or poop,
And bears behind him on his courser's croup;</pre><h5>LXXXVIII</h5><pre class="  ">Rather within his head or heart always
Care sits; whence every comfort is o'erthrown:
No remedy the wretched man surveys,
In that his enemies are in the town.
