Adorned the dome of Keysar or of king.</pre><h5>VI</h5><pre>If she had dwelt in Rimini of yore,
What time, from conquered Gaul returning home,
Julius stood fearing on the river-shore,
To ford the stream and make a foe of Rome,
He every banner would have bowed before
That dame, discharged his trophies, and such doom,
Such pact would have received as liked her best;
And haply ne'er had Freedom been opprest.</pre><h5>VII</h5><pre class="  ">The consort of my lord of Bozzolo
Behold!  the mother, sisters, cousinhood;
Them of Torello, Bentivoglio,
Pallavigini's and Visconti's brood!
Lo!  she to whom all living dames forego
The palm, and all of Grecian, Latin blood,
