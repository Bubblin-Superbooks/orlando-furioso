With sound of stridulous wing, through summer sky,
Or relics of a feast, their luscious dole,
Repair the ready numbers of the fly;
As starlings to the vineyard's crimsoning pole
With the ripe clusters charged, â€” heaven's concave high
Filling, as they advanced, with noise and shout,
Fast hurried to the storm the Moorish rout.</p><blockquote><p>CX</p></blockquote><p>Upon their walls the Christians in array,
With lance, sword, axe, and wild-fire tost,
The assaulted city guard without dismay,
And little reck the proud barbarian's boast:
Nor when death snatches this or that away,
Does any one in fear refuse his post.
Into the fosse below the paynim foes
Return, amid a storm of strokes and blows.</p><blockquote><p>CXI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
