Even with such freedom as his dart of wood
We mark the nimble Spaniard launch through air,
The heavy table Roland seized and threw,
Where, crowded close together, stood the crew.</pre><h5>XXXVIII</h5><pre>One had his belly crushed, and one his breast;
Another head or arm, or leg and thigh.
Whence some were slain outright, and maimed the rest,
While he who was least injured sought to fly.
'Tis so sometimes, with heavy stone oppressed,
A knot of slimy snakes is seen to lie,
With battered heads and loins where, winter done,
They lick their scales, rejoicing in the sun.</pre><h5>XXXIX</h5><pre class="  ">I could not say what mischiefs these offend;
One dies, and one departs without its tail;
Another crippled cannot move an-end,
