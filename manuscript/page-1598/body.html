As he renown and victory would obtain,
Whene'er his friendly squadrons should defend
From all barbarians else the Italian reign;

Thinking to bind her with the griding chain,

For what imperial Maurice shall bestow.

Thither where Ambra and Ticino flow!
Eutar behold, who not alone repels,
But puts the foe to flight, and routs and quells.</p><blockquote><p>XIV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Where they with Clovis tread the mountain</p></div> </div>
