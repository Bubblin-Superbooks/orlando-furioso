Grieved for the helmet, in her haste foregone
On her departure from the grassy fount.
"Choosing to do what I should least have done,"
(She said "I took his helmet from the count. ) 

This for his first desert I well bestow;
A worthy recompense for all I owe!</pre><h5>LXIV</h5><pre>"With good intentions, as God knows, I wrought;
Though these an ill and different end produce;
I took the helmet only with the thought
To bring that deadly battle to a truce;
And not that this foul Spaniard what he sought
Should gain, or I to his intent conduce."
So she, lamenting, took herself to task
For having robbed Orlando of his casque.</pre><h5>LXV</h5></div> </div>
