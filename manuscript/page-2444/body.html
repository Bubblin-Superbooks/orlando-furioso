The prison broke and prisoner away:
Of what became of him was nothing said.
— Towards the city by a secret way
(Nor was his visage seen Rogero sped. ) 

He, on the following morning, and his friend,
Leo, to Charles's court together wend.</pre><h5>LII</h5><pre>To Charles' court he wends; the bird he bore
Of gold with its two heads — of crimson hue
Its field — and that same vest and ensigns wore,
As was erewhile devised between the two;
And such as in the listed fight before
His bruised and battered armour was in shew.
So that they quickly knew the cavalier
From him that strove with Bradamant whilere.</pre><h5>LIII</h5></div> </div>
