Charged with the bidding he was bound to do.</p><blockquote><p>CXXIII</p></blockquote><p>"He bids the servant to the villa go,
And to Argia in his name pretend,
He by a fever is reduced so low,
She hardly can arrive before his end.
Hence without waiting escort — would she show
Her love — she with his man must backward wend,

But bid no less her purpose to pursue;
For he had taken thought for her; and aid
Should in the time of peril be purveyed.</p><blockquote><p>CXXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
