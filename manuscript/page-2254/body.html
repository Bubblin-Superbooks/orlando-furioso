After long search for good Rogero made,
Him Leon finds, and yields to him his prize:
Informed of all â€” already with that maid
He wives; already in her bosom lies:
When thither he that Sarza's sceptre swayed
To infect such bliss with impious venom hies,
But falls in combat; and, blaspheming loud,
To Acheron descends his spirit proud.</p><blockquote><p>I</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I, if my chart deceives me not, shall now
In little time behold the neighbouring shore;
So hope withal to pay my promised vow
To one, so long my guide through</p></div> </div>
