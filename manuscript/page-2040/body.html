That sought by good Astolpho and his throng,
He meditates, and compasses, a way
The frantic paladin on earth to lay.</pre><h5>LIV</h5><pre>He many a hawser made them thither bring,
And running knots in them he quickly tied;
Which on the count's waist, arms, and legs, they fling;
And then, among themselves, the ends divide,
Conveyed to this or that amid the ring,
Compassing Roland upon every side.
The warriors thus Orlando flung parforce,
As farrier throws the struggling ox or horse.</pre><h5>LV</h5><pre class="  ">As soon as down, they all upon him are,
And hands and feet more tightly they constrain:
He shakes himself, and plunges here and there;
But all his efforts for relief are vain.
