Sirs, show me but a single courtesy,
With which she ever graced ye, — old or new, —
As some poor recompense, desert, or guerdon,
For having born so long so sore a burden!</pre><h5>XXXII</h5><pre>Oh! couldst thou yet again to life return,
How hard would this appear, O Agricane!
In that she whilom thee was wont to spurn,
With sharp repulse and insolent disdain.
O Ferrau, O ye thousand more, forlorn,
Unsung, who wrought a thousand feats in vain
For this ungrateful fair, what pain 'twould be
Could you within his arms the damsel see!</pre><h5>XXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">To pluck, as yet untouched, the virgin rose,
Angelica permits the young Medore.
Was none so blest as in that garden's close
