To beauteous Bradamant that history,
Says, having shown her Ischia's island, "Ere
I lead you further other things to see,
I'll tell what my great-grandfather whilere
— I then a child — was wont to tell to me.
Which in like manner (that great-grandsire said),
As well to him his father whilome read;</p><blockquote><p>XXVI</p></blockquote><p>"And his from sire or grandsire heard recite;
So son from sire; even to that baron, who
Heard it related by the very wight,
That these fair pictures without pencil drew,
Which you see painted azure, red, and white.
He when to Pharamond (as now to you)
Was shown the castle on the rocky mount,
Heard him relate the things I now recount.</p><blockquote><p>XXVII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
