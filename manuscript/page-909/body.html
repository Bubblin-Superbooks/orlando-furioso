Nor listened to the drum or trumpet's sound.
So scared, so crowded is the wretched crew,
That many in Seine's neighbouring stream are drowned,
Agramant, who would form the band anew,
(With him Sobrino scowers the squadrons round; ) 

And with them every leader good combines
To bring the routed host within their lines.</pre><h5>CLX</h5><pre class="  ">But nought by sovereign or Sobrino done,
Who, toiling, them with prayer or menace stirred,
To march, where their ill-followed flags are gone.
Can bring (I say not all not even a third. ) 

Slaughtered or put to flight are two for one
