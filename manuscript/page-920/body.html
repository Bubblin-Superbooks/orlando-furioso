Ten ladies are the partners of my bed:
Selected at my choice, who are the best
And fairest damsels in this kingdom bred:
These I command, as well as all the rest,
Who of their female band have made me head;
And so would make another who in fight,
Like me, ten opposites to death would smite."</p><blockquote><p>IX</p></blockquote><p>Sir Guido is besought of them to say
Why there appear so few of the male race,
And to declare if women there bear sway
O'er men, as men o'er them in other place.

I oftentimes have heard relate the case;
And now (according to the story told)
Will, since it pleases you, the cause unfold.</p><blockquote><p>X</p></blockquote></div> </div>
