<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre>The monster, slaughtered by the brethren two,
Upon the sand beside the haven lies;
And hence no wrong they to Orrilo do,
Assailing him together in this guise.
Him they dismembered often and not slew:
Now he, — because dismembered, — ever dies;
For he replaces leg or hand like wax,
Which the good faulchion from his body hacks.</pre><h5>LXX</h5><pre>Gryphon and Aquilant by turns divide,
Now to the teeth, now breast, the enchanted wight.
The fruitless blow Orrilo does deride,
While the two baffled warriors rage for spite.
Let him who falling silver has espied
(Which mercury by alchymists is hight)
Scatter, and reunite each broken member,
Hearing my tale, what he has seen remember.</pre><h5>LXXI</h5></div> </div>
