Forth issued into day that figure dread
From devilish darkness and the caverned deep.
For tail, a fierce and bigger serpent wound
About her breast, and girt the monster round.</pre><h5>XLVIII</h5><pre>What in a thousand, thousand quests had ne'er

Coming to seek him and prepared for fight,
Feels in his inmost veins such freezing fear,
As haply never fell on other wight;
Yet wonted daring counterfeits and feigns,
And with a trembling hand the faulchion strains.</pre><h5>XLIX</h5><pre class="  ">The monster so the fierce assault did make
Therein her master was well descried,
It might be said; she shook a poisonous snake,
