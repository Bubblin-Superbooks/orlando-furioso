<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With frigate and with galley wont to roam,
And other sort of barks they range the sea,
And, as a solace to their martyrdom,
From far, or from their isle's vicinity,
Bear women off; with open rapine some,
These bought by gold, and those by flattery:
And, plundered from the different lands they scower,
Crowd with their captives dungeon-cell and tower.</p><blockquote><p>LXI</p></blockquote><p>Keeping that region close aboard, to explore
The island's lonely bank, a gallery creeps;
Where, amid stubs upon the grassy shore,
Angelica, unhappy damsel, sleeps.
To wood and water there the sailor's moor,
And from the bark, for this, a party leaps;
And there that matchless flower of earthly charms
Discovers in the holy father's arms.</p><blockquote><p>LXII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Oh!  prize too dear, oh!  too illustrious prey!
To glut</p></div> </div>
