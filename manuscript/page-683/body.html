<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Where dwells a giant, horrible to sight,
Exceeding every stature by eight feet.
From him wayfaring man or errant knight
Would vainly hope with life to make retreat;
For some the felon quarters, some he flays,
And some he swallows quick, and some he slays.</pre><h5>XLIV</h5><pre>"He, 'mid the cruel horrors he intends,
Takes pleasure in a net, by cunning hands
Contrived, which near his mansion he extends;
So well concealed beneath the crumbling sands,
That whoso uninstructed thither wends,
Nought of the subtle mischief understands;
And so the giant scares him with his cries,
That he within the toils in terror flies;</pre><h5>XLV</h5><pre class="  ">"Whom with loud laughter, to his seat hard by
He drags along, enveloped in his snare;
