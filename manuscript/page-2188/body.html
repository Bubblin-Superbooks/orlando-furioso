Of crossing to the river's further side.

With covert guile; he took a circuit wide,
Then thither made return; his bridges placed
From bank to bank, and past the stream in haste.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXII</p></blockquote><p>With many horse and foot in battle dight,

And fiercely charged his enemies in flank.

Uniting bridge and bark together, crost
Upon his part the stream with all his host.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">King Vatran, chief of the Bulgarian band,

Laboured in vain such onset to withstand,
