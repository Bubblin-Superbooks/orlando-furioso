To his desires.  She in that lone retreat
And savage, open to his evil aim,
And like a mouse, beneath Grimalkin's feet,
Had liefer found herself i' the midst of flame;
And ever on one thought her fancy beat:

To scape that wilful man, untouched, unstained.</p><blockquote><p>XI</p></blockquote><p>Sad Isabella in her mind is bent
To slay herself with her own hand, before

And be the means to make her wrong so sore
That cavalier, by cruel Fortune spent,
Within her loving arms, to whom she swore
With mind to him devoted, his to be,
Vowing to Heaven perpetual chastity.</p><blockquote><p>XII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">She sees that paynim monarch's passion blind
Increasing still, nor what to do she knows;
