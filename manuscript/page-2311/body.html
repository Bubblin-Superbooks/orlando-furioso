And France will welcome wide their wedded love.</pre><h5>XII</h5><pre>So spake together peer and paladine:

The heir and hope, to crave the maid had sent.

With love of her unseen was Leo fired.</pre><h5>XIII</h5><pre class="  ">To him hath Aymon answered: he, alone,

Who with winged haste, he deems, will thither run,
And joy in kinsman of such high report;
