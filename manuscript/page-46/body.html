<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The warlike Saracen's ill-fated horse,
Well valued while alive, dropt short and dead:
The stranger's, too, fell senseless; but perforce
Was roused by rowel from his grassy bed.
That of the paynim king, extended straight,
Lay on his battered lord with all his weight.</pre><h5>LXIV</h5><pre>Upright upon his steed, the knight unknown,
Who at the encounter horse and rider threw,
Deeming enough was in the conflict done,
Cares not the worthless warfare to renew;
But endlong by the readiest path is gone,
And measures, pricking frith and forest through,
A mile, or little less, in furious heat,
Ere the foiled Saracen regains his feet.</pre><h5>LXV</h5><pre class="  ">As the bewildered and astonished clown
Who held the plough (the thunder storm o'erpast)
