<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">wended,
Which thence into a lowly vale descended.</p><blockquote><p>XII</p></blockquote><p>A rock from that deep valley's centre springs;
Bright walls of steel about its summit go:
And this as high that airy summit flings,
As it leaves all the neighbouring cliffs below.
He may not scale the height who has not wings,
And vainly would each painful toil bestow.
"Lo!  where his prisoners!"  Sir Brunello cries,
"Ladies and cavaliers, the enchanter sties."</p><blockquote><p>XIII</p></blockquote><p>Scarped smooth upon four parts, the mountain bare
Seemed fashioned with the plumb, by builder's skill
Nor upon any side was path or stair,
Which furnished man the means to climb the hill.
The castle seemed the very nest and lair
Of animal, supplied with plume and quill.
And here the damsel knows 'tis time to slay
The wily dwarf, and take the ring away.</p><blockquote><p>XIV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
