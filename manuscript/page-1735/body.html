All over bathed with blood of hostile vein.
But valour stoops at last to numbers; lo!
The king is taken, is conveyed to Spain;
And all upon Pescara's lord bestow
And him of that inseparable twain —
Of Guasto hight — the praise and prime renown
For that great king captived and host o'erthrown.</pre><h5>LIV</h5><pre>"This host o'erthrown upon Pavia's plains,
That, bound for Naples, halts upon its way:
As an ill-nourished lamp or taper wanes,
For want of wax or oil, with flickering ray.
Lo!  the king leaves his sons in Spanish chains,
And home returns, his own domain to sway.
Lo!  while in Italy he leads his band,
Another wars upon his native land.</pre><h5>LV</h5></div> </div>
