And, though fallacious every hope she feeds,
Another and another aye succeeds.</pre><h5>XVI</h5><pre>And then she arms, and will the warrior meet;
And from the hill descends into the plain:
She finds him not, and to Montalban's seat
Hopes he by other road his way has ta'en.
In the design, wherewith she moved her feet
From thence, she to her fort returns in vain;
Nor finds him here nor there; meanwhile expired
The period whose approach she so desired.</pre><h5>XVII</h5><pre class="  ">— The period so prefixt o'erpast by one,
By two, three, six, by eight, by twenty days —
She seeing not her spouse, and tidings none
Receiving of the youth, laments 'gan raise,
Which had from snake-haired Furies pity won,
