But do a hundred battles, well content:
Then of my person, where it may avail,
Dispose (Rogero said to you intent. ) 

Silver and land to conquer, plate or mail
I swear not, I, in warlike cuirass pent;
But to afford my aid to others due;
And, most of all, to beauteous dames like you."</pre><h5>LXXXI</h5><pre>Their grateful thanks the ladies, worthily
Bestowed on such a valiant champion, paid:
They talking thus the bridge and river see,
And at her post the haughty dame arraid
(Sapphire and emerald decked the panoply)
In arms of gold: but I awhile delay
Till other strain the issue of the fray.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
