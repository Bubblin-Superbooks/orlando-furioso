<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">A city to the left Rogero sees;
And there all day determines to repose,
As where he may his wearied courser ease,
Whom he so far that livelong night had pressed;
Nor had he drawn his bit, nor given him rest.</pre><h5>CII</h5><pre>Ungiardo had that city in his guard,
Constantine's liegeman, and to him right dear;
Who, since upon the Bulgars he had warred,
Much horse and foot had sent that emperor; here
Now entered (for the entrance was not barred)
Rogero, and found such hospitable cheer,
He to fare further had no need, in trace
Of better or of more abundant place.</pre><h5>CIII</h5><pre class="  ">In the same hostelry with him a guest
Was lodged that evening a Romanian knight;
Present what time the Child with lance in rest
