<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre>The monks and abbot to Mount Alban's peer
A goodly welcome in their house accord;
Who asked, but not before with savoury cheer
He amply had his wearied strength restored,
If in that tract, by errant cavalier,
Often adventurous quest might be explored,
In which a man might prove, by dangerous deed,
If blame or glory were his fitting meed.</pre><h5>LVI</h5><pre>They answered, in those woods he might be sure
Many and strange adventures would be found;
But deeds, there wrought, were, like the place, obscure,
And, for the greater part, not bruited round.
"Then seek (they said a worthier quest, secure ) 

Your works will not be buried underground.
So that the glorious act achieved, as due,
Fame may your peril and your pain pursue.</pre></div> </div>
