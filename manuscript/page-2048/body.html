<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Their nimble quarry, is pursued in vain,
As if ashamed they in that chase did lag,
Return repentant and in high disdain:
So, with a sigh, return those damsels two,
When they the paynim king in safety view:</pre><h5>LXX</h5><pre>Yet therefore halt not, but in fury go
Amid that crowd, which flies, possest with dread;
Feeling, now here, now there, at every blow,
Many that never more uprear their head.
To evil pass was brought the broken foe;
For safety was not even for them that fled:
Since Agramant, a sure retreat to gain,
Bade shut the city-gate which faced the plain;</pre><h5>LXXI</h5><pre class="  ">And bade on Rhone break all the bridges down.
Unhappy people, ever held as cheap
â€” Weighed with the tyrant's want who wears a crown</pre></div> </div>
