Had vaunted to the maid in boasting vein,
No paladin or knight with lance in rest,
Against the worst his saddle could maintain.
To make them vail yet more their haughty crest,
And look upon the world with less disdain,
She tells them, by no paladin or peer
Were they unhorsed, but by a woman's spear.</pre><h5>LXXII</h5><pre class="  ">"Now what of Roland's and Rinaldo's might,
Not without reason held in such renown,
Ought you to think (she said when thus in fight ) 

Ye by a female hand are overthrown?
Say, if the buckler one of these requite,
â€” Better than by a woman ye have done,
Will ye by those redoubted warriors do?
