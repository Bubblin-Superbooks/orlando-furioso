And smites Sir Serpentine, him of the star.
Though charmed from mischief are the cavalier's
Good arms, he falls astounded by the jar,
And thus Rinaldo round Zerbino clears
The field so widely, where those champions war,
That without more dispute he takes a horse
Of those, who masterless, at random, course.</pre><h5>LXXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">That he in time remounted it was well,
Who haply would not, if he more delayed:
For Agramant at once, and Dardinel,
