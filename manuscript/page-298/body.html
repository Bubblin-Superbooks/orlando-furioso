A longer life than ever mortal wight,
Than Hecuba or she in Cuma bred;
But thus by practice, to our age unknown,
Appeared with youth and beauty not her own.</pre><h5>LXXIV</h5><pre>By art she gave herself the lovely look,

But now the ring interpreted the book,
Which secrets, hid for many ages, taught.
No wonder then that he the dame forsook,
And banished from his mind all further thought
Of love for false Alcina, found in guise
Which no new means of slippery fraud supplies.</pre><h5>LXXV</h5><pre class="  ">But, as Melissa counselled him, he wore
His wonted semblance for a time, till he
Was with his armour, many days before
