Slaughtered a mighty number of her guard,
Remained nigh dead, o'erwhelmed with her distress;
She tore her vesture, and her visage marred,
And cursed her want of wit and wariness.
Then made forthwith her meiny sound to arms,
And round herself arrayed her martial swarms.</p><blockquote><p>XIII</p></blockquote><p>Divided next, one squadron by the way
Rogero took, she sent; the bands were two:
She at the port embarked the next array,
And straight to sea dispatched the warlike crew.
With this good squadron went the desperate fay,
And darked by loosened sails the billows grew;
For so desire upon her bosom preyed,
Of troops she left her city unpurveyed.</p><blockquote><p>XIV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Without a guard she left her palace there,
Which to Melissa, prompt her time to seize,
To loose her vassals</p></div> </div>
