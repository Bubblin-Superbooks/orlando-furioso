Visage, legs, arms, and bosom overgrown
With hair, like beasts.  Lo!  yonder, where they press
About a standard white, the level down
Of lances seems a bristling wilderness.
Such Moray's flag, the savage squadron's head,
Who means with Moorish blood to paint it red."</pre><h5>XC</h5><pre>What time Rogero sees the fair array,
Whose bands to succour ravaged France prepare,
And notes and talks of ensigns they display,
And names of British lords, to him repair
One and another, crowding to survey
His courser, single of its kind, or rare:
All thither hasten, wondering and astound,
And compassing the warrior, form a round.</pre><h5>XCI</h5><pre class="  ">So that to raise more wonder in the train.
