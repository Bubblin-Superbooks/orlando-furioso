To all her gods and Mahound, in despair!
â€” That they, by open miracle, the maid
Would change, and give her other sex to wear.
But all the lady's vows were ill appaid,
And haply Heaven as well might mock the prayer;
Night fades, and Phoebus raises from the main
His yellow head, and lights the world again.</p><blockquote><p>XLV</p></blockquote><p>"On issueing from their bed when day is broken,
The wretched Flordespina's woes augment:
For of departing Bradamant had spoken,
Anxious to scape from that embarrassment.
The princess a prime jennet, as a token,
Forced on my parting sister, when she went;
And gilded housings, and a surcoat brave,
Which her own hand had richly broidered, gave.</p><blockquote><p>XLVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Her Flordespine accompanied some way,
Then, weeping, to her castle made return.
So fast my sister</p></div> </div>
