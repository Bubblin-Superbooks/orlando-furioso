Slew thee not, as the faulchion slew thy son.</pre><h5>VIII</h5><pre>Cruel Sclavonian!  say, whence hast thou brought
Thy ways of warfare?  By what Scythian rite
To slay the helpless prisoner is it taught,
Who yields his arms, nor fends himself in fight?
Was it a crime he for his country fought?
Ill upon thee the sun bestows his light.
Remorseless aera, which hast filled the page
With Atreus', Tantalus', Thyestes' rage!</pre><h5>IX</h5><pre class="  ">Barbarian!  thou madest shorter by the head
The boldest of his age, on whom did beam
The sun 'twixt pole and pole, 'twixt Indus' bed
And where he sinks in Ocean's western stream;
Whose years and beauty might have pity bred
In Anthropophagus, in Polypheme;
