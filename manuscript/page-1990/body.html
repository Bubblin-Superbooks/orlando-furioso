Your Africk from such host in peril lies?
Your garrisons were sure of coward vein,
If they were scared by such a craven train.</pre><h5>XLVI</h5><pre>"But will you send some frigates, albeit few,
(Provided that unfurled your standards be)
No sooner shall they loose from hence, that crew
Of spoilers shall within their confines flee;

Knowing that you are severed by the sea
From your own realm, and warring with our band,
Have taken courage to assail your land.</pre><h5>XLVII</h5><pre class="  ">"Now take your time for vengeance, when the son
Of Pepin is without his nephew's aid.
Since bold Orlando is away, by none
Of the hostile sect resistance can be made.
