Adding a palm of stature to her height;
And made her limbs of a proportioned size;
And of the very measure seemed to sight,
As was she deemed, the necromancer wise,
Who with such care had reared the youthful knight.
With long-descending beard she clothed her chin,
And wrinkled o'er her front and other skin.</p><blockquote><p>LII</p></blockquote><p>To imitate his speech, and face, and cheer,
She knew so well, that, by the youth descried,
She might the sage Atlantes' self appear;
Next hid, and watched so long, that she espied
Upon a day (rare chance the cavalier )</p><p>At length detached from his Alcina's side:
For still, in motion or at rest, the fay
Ill bore the youth should be an hour away.</p><blockquote><p>LIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
