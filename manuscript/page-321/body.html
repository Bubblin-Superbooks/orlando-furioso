And wasted flowers, and trees uptore and rent.

Joust warring winds, north, south, and east, unpent.

Through every sounding wood and plain repeats.

Demands his aid, the lamentation hears.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Thither, whence comes the sound, he swiftly hies,
And toils, now here, now there, with labour sore:
