While still his thoughts to his ill consort stray,
Jocundo languishes; nor pastimes please
That melancholy man; nor music's strain
One jot diminishes his ceaseless pain.</pre><h5>XXXII</h5><pre>"Above his chambers, on the upper floor,

A remedy unhoped, which made him sound.</pre><h5>XXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">"At that hall's farther end, more feebly lighted,
