Your praise to all posterity to tell.</pre><h5>XIV</h5><pre>And beside these and others of our day,
Who gave you once, or give you now renown,
This for yourselves ye may yourselves purvey:
For many, laying silk and sampler down,
With the melodious Muses, to allay
Their thirst at Aganippe's well, have gone,
And still are going; who so fairly speed,
That we more theirs than they our labour need.</pre><h5>XV</h5><pre>If I of these would separately tell,
And render good account and honour due,
More than one page I with their praise should swell,</pre><blockquote><p>Canto shew;
And if on five or six alone I dwell,
I may offend and anger all the crew.
What then shall I resolve? to pass all by?
Or choose but one from such a company?</p>
