'Tis she that, of her Brandimart in chase,
(If you remember, sir, through every road ) 

And place her lover seeks in anxious wise,
Excepting Paris, where the warrior lies.</pre><h5>XLIV</h5><pre>When Flordelice that bridge and tower was near,
(So was by name the wandering damsel hight)

And would into that river pitch the knight.

The miserable county knew aright;
And mighty marvel in that dame it raised
To see him rove, a naked man and crazed.</pre><h5>XLV</h5><pre class="  ">She stopt, the issue of that strife to know,
Wherein those two so puissant warriors vied.
