Within the gorgeous palace of the king.
Seated alone here guest and sovereign are,
And the attendant troop the viands bring.
Behold!  a whizzing sound is heard in air,
Which echoes with the beat of savage wing.
Behold!  the band of harpies thither flies,
Lured by the scent of victual from the skies.</pre><h5>CXX</h5><pre>All bear a female face of pallid dye,
And seven in number are the horrid band;
Emaciated with hunger, lean, and dry;
Fouler than death; the pinions they expand
Ragged, and huge, and shapeless to the eye;
The talon crook'd; rapacious is the hand;
Fetid and large the paunch; in many a fold,
Like snake's, their long and knotted tails are rolled.</pre></div> </div>
