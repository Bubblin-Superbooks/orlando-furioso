<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre>Though none for whom I hitherto have sighed
— Of those so many — have kept faith with me,
All with ingratitude, or falsehood dyed
I deem not, I accuse my destiny.
Many there are, and have been more beside
Unmeriting reproach: but if there be,
'Mid hundreds, one or two of evil way,
My fortune wills that I should be their prey.</pre><h5>CXXIV</h5><pre>Yet will I make such search before I die,
Rather before my hair shall wax more white,
That haply on some future day, even I
Shall say, "That one has kept her promise plight."
And should not the event my trust belie,
(Nor am I hopeless I with all my might ) 

Will with unwearied pain her praise rehearse
With pen and ink and voice, in prose and verse.</pre></div> </div>
