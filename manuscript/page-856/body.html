But mortals Destiny would set at nought
If every wight futurity were taught.</p><blockquote><p>CLXXVIII</p></blockquote><p>As, in full fold, a lion long unfed,
Whom wasting famine had made lean and spare,
Devours and rends, and swallows, and lays dead
The feeble flock, which at his mercy are;
So, in their sleep, the cruel paynim bled
Our host, and made wide slaughter everywhere:
Nor blunted was the young Medoro's sword,
But he disdained to smite the ignoble horde.</p><blockquote><p>CLXXIX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">He to Labretto's duke, leaving those dead,
Had come, who slumbered with a gentle mate,
Each clasping each so closely in their bed,
That air between them could not penetrate.
From both Medoro cleanly lopt the head.
Oh!  blessed way of death!  oh!  happy fate!
For 'tis my trust, that as their bodies, so
Their souls</p></div> </div>
