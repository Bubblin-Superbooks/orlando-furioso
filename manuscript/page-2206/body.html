<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Of others that would shine thou dimm'st the praise;
Whom other studies, other arts would raise.</pre><h5>IV</h5><pre>What shall of high and beauteous dames be said?
Who (from their lovers' worth and charms secure)
Against long service, I behold, more staid,
More motionless, than marble shafts, endure:
Then Avarice comes, who so her spells hath laid,
I see them stoop directly to her lure.
— Who could believe? — unloving, in a day
They fall some elder's, fall some monster's prey.</pre><h5>V</h5><pre class="  ">Not without reason here I raise this cry:
— Read me who can, I read myself — nor so
I from the beaten pathway tread awry,
Nor thus the matter of my song forego.
Not more to what is shown do I apply
My saying, than to what I have to show.
