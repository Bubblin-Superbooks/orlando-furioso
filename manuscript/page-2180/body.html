Thou need'st not dig a ditch nor build a tower,
In fear lest any rob thee of that power.</p><blockquote><p>LXIV</p></blockquote><p>"For if thou hire no aids, assault is none,
But what thereon shall aye be made in vain;
Nor shall it be by any riches won:
So vile a price no gentle heart can gain:
Nor by nobility, nor kingly crown,
That dazzle so the silly vulgar train;
Nor beauty, puissant with the weak and light,
Shall ever make me thee for other slight.</p><blockquote><p>LXV</p></blockquote><p>"Thou hast no cause, amid thy griefs, to fear
My heart should ever bear new impress more:
So deeply is thine image graven here,
It cannot be removed: that my heart's core
Is not of wax is proved; for Love whilere
Smote it a hundred times, not once, before
He by his blows a single scale displaced,
What time therein his hand thine image traced.</p><blockquote><p>LXVI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
