Of every thing, — and how, in white array,
That warrior, with the lady and the rest,
Had to the city measured back their way.
By little and by little, Gryphon guessed
What love from him had hidden till that day;
And knew, to his great sorrow, in the other
Origille's paramour, and not her brother.</pre><h5>CXVI</h5><pre>Now he lamenting for his folly stood,
That having heard the truths the pilgrim said,
He should have let her story change his mood,
Who him before so often had betrayed.
He might have venged himself, nor did: — now wou'd,
Too late, inflict the punishment delaid;
Constrained (a crying error! in his need ) 

To take that wily treachour's arms and steed.</pre></div> </div>
