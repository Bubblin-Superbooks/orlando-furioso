By what enchained me first, that lovely hair;
My spirit, troubled and despairing, hies
Into hell's deep and gloomy bottom; where

Of all its woes the heaviest pain will be."</pre><h5>LXXX</h5><pre>At this the sorrowing Isabel, declining
Her mournful face, which with her tears o'erflows,
Towards the sufferer, and her mouth conjoining
To her Zerbino's, languid as a rose;
Rose gathered out of season, and which, pining
Fades where it on the shadowy hedgerow grows,
Exclaims, "Without me think not so, my heart,
On this your last, long, journey to depart.</pre><h5>LXXXI</h5><pre class="  ">"Of this, my heart, conceive not any fear,
For I will follow thee to heaven or hell;
