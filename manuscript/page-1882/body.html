And says: "Unless I speak with you I die.
Hear me, for love of heaven! â€” what done I done,
Alas!  that ever mine approach ye shun?"</pre><h5>XL</h5><pre>As when soft southern breezes are unpent,
Which with a tepid breath from seaward blow,
The snows dissolve, and torrents find a vent,
And ice, so hard erewhile, is seen to flow;
At those entreaties, at that brief lament,
Rinaldo's sister's heart is softened so;
Forthwith compassionate and pious grown;
Which anger fain had made more hard than stone.</pre><h5>XLI</h5><pre class="  ">Would she not, could she not, she nought replied,
But spurred aslant the ready Rabicane,
And, signing to Rogero, rode as wide
As she could wend from that embattled train;
