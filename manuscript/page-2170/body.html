<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">will,
Which 'tis my duty ever to fulfil?</p><blockquote><p>XLII</p></blockquote><p>"Wo worth the while!  and shall I then to thee
By filial love be forced to be untrue,
O my Rogero, and surrender me
To a new hope, a new love, and a new
Desire; or rather from those ties break free,
From all good children to good parents due;
Observance, reverence cast aside; and measure
My duty by my happiness, my pleasure?</p><blockquote><p>XLIII</p></blockquote><p>"I know, alas!  what I should do; I know
That which a duteous daughter doth behove;
I know; but what avails it, if not so
My reason moves me as my senses move;
If she retires before a stronger foe;
Nor can I of myself dispose, for Love;
Nor think how to dispose; so strict his sway;
Nor, saving as he dictates, do and say?</p><blockquote><p>XLIV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
