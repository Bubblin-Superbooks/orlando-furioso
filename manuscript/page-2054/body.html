That many vessels to the bottom went;
Then, taxing wits and hands, to work them woe,
Them with fire, sword, and stones the Christians shent;
Which on their ships in such wide ruin pour,
Like tempest never vext the sea before.</pre><h5>LXXXII</h5><pre>Bold Dudon's men, to whom unwonted might
And daring was imparted from on high,

For more than one ill deed, from far and nigh, )

Agramant finds no shelter; from the sky
Above, thick clouds of whistling arrows strike;
Around gleam hook and hatchet, sword and pike.</pre><h5>LXXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">The king hears huge and heavy stones descend,
