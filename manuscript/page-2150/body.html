Rinaldo his sister to the Child hath plight,
And to Marseilles is with the warrior gone:
And having crimsoned wide the field in fight,
Therein arrives King Otho's valiant son.
To Paris thence: where to that squadron bright
Is mighty grace and wonderous honour done.
The Child departs, resolved on Leo's slaughter,
To whom Duke Aymon had betrothed his daughter.</p><blockquote><p>I</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In poor abode, mid paltry walls and bare,
Amid discomforts and calamities,
Often in friendship heart</p></div> </div>
