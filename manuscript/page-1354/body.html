Save he from Rodomont redeems the prey,
And with a due revenge that wrong repay.</pre><h5>LXVI</h5><pre>With him, without repose, the damsel rides,
Who with his foe would bring him front to front;
And thither journies where the road divides,
And one branch cuts the plain, one climbs the mount,
And either pathway to that valley guides,
Where she had newly left King Rodomont,
The mountain track was short, but trod with pain;
That other longer far, but smooth and plain.</pre><h5>LXVII</h5><pre class="  ">Hippalca's ardour to retrieve the prey,
And upon Rodomont's avenge the wrong,
Incites that maid the mountain to assay;
By which (as said the journey was less long: )
