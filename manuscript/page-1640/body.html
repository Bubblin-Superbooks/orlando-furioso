Rose all about, that hill, dale, wood, and glade,
From distant parts, the deafening din rebounded;

And thence commodiously to Arles transport;
Whither their wasted squadrons make resort.</pre><h5>LXXXIX</h5><pre class="  ">Chased by Rinaldo and King Charlemagne,

By wood, by mountain, valley, and by plain,
