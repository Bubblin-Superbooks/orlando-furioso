<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Throughout all that and the succeeding day,
Till the forenoon, proceed those banded friends;
And, where the main-road branches, and one way
Towards the camp, to Arles the other tends,
Again embrace the lovers, and oft say
A last farewell, which evermore offends.
The damsels seek the camp; to Arles is gone</p><blockquote><p>Canto I have done.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
