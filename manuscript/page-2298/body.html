The champion so complain, his outcries fill
Orlando and all that company with fear.

A lonely rock inhabits in this sea;
Whose isle none, seeking succour, vainly tread,
Whether for counsel or for aid it be:
Who hath done superhuman deeds; the dead
Restores to life; and makes the blind to see;
Hushes the winds; and with a sign o' the cross
Lulls the loud billows when they highest toss;</pre><h5>CLXXXVIII</h5><pre class="  ">And adds they need not doubt, if they will go
To seek that holy man to God so dear,
But he on Olivier will health bestow;
