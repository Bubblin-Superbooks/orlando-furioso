And it will soothe me, though of thee I borrow
No help, that thou compassionate my sorrow.</pre><h5>VI</h5><pre>"My father in his city of Bayonne,

To joust, from different lands came many a knight;

Or was it love which so deceived my sight)
Praise in my eyes alone Zerbino won,

Performing wondrous feats of chivalry,
I was surprised by Love, ere I descried
That freedom in my Love, so rash a guide,
