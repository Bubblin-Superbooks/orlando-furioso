<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">For better I without a soul could dwell
Than without Bradamant remain alive.
And never while these veins with life-blood swell
Canst thou with her legitimately wive:
For vows erewhile have been between us said;
Nor she at once can with two husbands wed."</pre><h5>XXXVIII</h5><pre>So filled is gentle Leo with amaze
When he the stranger for Rogero knows,
With lips and brow unmoved, with stedfast gaze
And rooted feet, he like a statue shows;
Like statue more than man, which votaries raise
In churches, for acquittance of their vows.
He deems that courtesy of so high a strain
Was never done nor will be done again;</pre><h5>XXXIX</h5><pre class="  ">And that he him doth for Rogero know
Not only that goodwill he bore whilere
