But first he to a cavalier consigned
The tower; whereof that baron he possest,

Should in this hall be harboured without fail:
They that less worthy were should void the tower,
And seek another inn, by hill or dale.

To Bradamant recounts that castle's lord,
The sewer with savoury meats has heaped the board.</p><blockquote><p>XCV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In the great hall that plenteous board was laid,
(None fairer was in all the world beside)
Then came where those beauteous ladies stayed,
And them, with torches lit, did thither guide.
