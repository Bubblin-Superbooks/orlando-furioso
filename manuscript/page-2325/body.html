If what she will not do, she falsely say:
She will not, for she cannot; since above
All guidance, great or small, is mighty Love.</pre><h5>XL</h5><pre>Deny she dared not, nor yet seem content;
So, sighed and spake not; but — when uncontrolled
She could — she gave her secret sorrow vent,
While from her eyes the tears like billows rolled;
A portion of the pains that her torment,
Inflicting on her breast and locks of gold:
For this she beat, and those uptore and brake;
And thus she made lament, and thus she spake.</pre><h5>XLI</h5><pre class="  ">"Ah!  shall I will what she wills not, by right
More sovereign mistress of my will than I?
Hers shall I hold so cheaply, so to slight
A mother's will, my own to satisfy?
