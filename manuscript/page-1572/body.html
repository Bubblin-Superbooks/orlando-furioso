By dame and knight already housed, who, met
About the fire, in that chill evening-tide,
Wait till their supper be before them set.
To him that maid: "The board is not supplied,
I deem, for them, unless the meal be eat.
Now, say I wait their coming." (she pursues,)
Who know and will observe your castle's use."</p><blockquote><p>LXXI</p></blockquote><p>The guard his message bore, where at their ease
Reposed the weary cavaliers; his tale
Not overlikely was those kings to please;
For cold and peevish blew the wintry gale,
And now fast fell the rain; yet, forced to seize
Their arms, they slowly don the martial mail.
The rest remain within; while they proceed
Against the damsel, but with little speed.</p><blockquote><p>LXXII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Three cavaliers they were, of might so tried,
