The lioness beside the lion lies:
Wolves, male and female, live in loving cheer;
Nor gentle heifer dreads the wilful steer.</code></pre><blockquote><p>II</p></blockquote><pre><code>What Fury, what abominable Pest
Such poison in the human heart has shed,
That still 'twixt man and wife, with rage possessed,
Injurious words and foul reproach are said?
And blows and outrage hase their peace molest,
And bitter tears still wash the genial bed;
Not only watered by the tearful flood,
But often bathed by senseless ire with blood?</code></pre><blockquote><p>III</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>Not simply a rank sinner, he appears
To outrage nature, and his God to dare,
Who his foul hand against a woman</pre></div> </div>
