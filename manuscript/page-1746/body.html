Marphisa fell, reversed upon the ground.</p><blockquote><p>XXIII</p></blockquote><p>Scarce down, Marphisa started from the plain,
Intent fell mischief with her sword to do,
Bradamant couched her golden spear again,
And yet again the damsel overthrew.
Yet Bradamant, though blest with might and main,
Was not so much the stronger of the two
As to have flung the maid in every just,
But that such power was in the lance's thrust.</p><blockquote><p>XXIV</p></blockquote><p>This while some knights (some knights upon our side,

The squadrons, here and there, of either foe

Their knight, but whom no otherwise they knew
