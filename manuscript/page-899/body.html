Will run her risque; and 'tis her destiny.
"I will lay down this life," the damsel said,
"Rather than you lay down your liberty.
But this" — with that she pointed to the blade
Which she had girt — "is your security,
I will all tangles in such manner loose,
As Alexander did the Gordian noose.</p><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote><p>"I will not henceforth stranger shall complain,
So long as the world lasts, of this repair."
So said the maid, nor could the friendly train
Take from her what had fallen to her share.
Then, — either every thing to lose, or gain
Their liberty, — to her they leave the care.
With stubborn plate and mail all over steeled,
Ready for cruel fight, she takes the field.</p><blockquote><p>LXXVI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
