Amid the Africans had left the peer.
Rinaldo turned about and took his way
Where he beheld the Scots in disarray.</pre><h5>LXXX</h5><pre>He plants his courser, where their squadrons yield
To the fierce paynims, and exclaims:  "Where go
Your bands, and why so basely quit the field,
Yielding so vilely to so vile a foe?
Behold the promised trophies, spear and shield,
Spoils which your loaded churches ought to show!
What praise!  what glory!  that alone, and reft
Of his good horse, your monarch's son is left!</pre><h5>LXXXI</h5><pre class="  ">He from a squire receives a lance, and spies
King Prusion little distant, sovereign
Of the Alvaracchiae, and against him hies;
Whom he unhorses, dead upon the plain.
