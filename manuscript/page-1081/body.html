To his unhappy life's disastrous end,
And he who slew him never had such thought,
Nor this would have believed: to aid his friend
Intent, (strange chance! he wrought him in that blow ) 

The worst that could be done by mortal foe.</pre><h5>L</h5><pre>"When now, unknown, on earth Argaeus lay,
My brother to Gabrina gave the blade,
(So was she named who lived but to betray. ) 

She, who discovery had till then delayed,
Wills that Philander with a light survey
The man whom he on earth has lifeless laid,
And she, with the assistance of the light,
Shows him Argaeus in the murdered wight.</pre><h5>LI</h5></div> </div>
