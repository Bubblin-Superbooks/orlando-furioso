Nor will I halt upon my way, till I
Once more rejoin my husband and my lord;

Others, and others yet, I mean to move."</p><blockquote><p>LIX</p></blockquote><p>"My company (replied the martial fair)
For some part of the road, I offer thee,
Till we have sight of Arles; then to repair
Thither, will pray you, for the love of me,
To find King Agramant's Rogero there,
Whose glorious name is spread o'er land and sea,
And render to that knight this goodly horse,
Whence the proud Moor was flung in martial course.</p><blockquote><p>LX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Say thus, from point to point, `A cavalier
