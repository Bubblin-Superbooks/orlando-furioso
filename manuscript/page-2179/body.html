<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Rinaldo, linked in many a loathsome loop,
Who sweats at once with heat and quakes with cold,
Nor can he thrust the monster from his croup.
Arrived the stranger smote her in the flank,
Who on the near side of the courser sank:</pre><h5>LVI</h5><pre>But scarcely was on earth extended, ere
She rose and shook her snakes in volumed spire.
The knight no more assails her with the spear;
But is resolved to plague the foe with fire:
He gripes the mace and thunders in her rear
With frequent blows, like tempest in its ire;
Nor leaves a moment to that monster fell
To strike one stroke in answer, ill or well;</pre><h5>LVII</h5><pre class="  ">And, while he chases her or holds at bay,
Smites her and venges many a foul affront,
Counsels the paladin, without delay,
</pre></div> </div>
