Charles would not think he should exceed due measure
If spent for her was half his kingdom's treasure.</p><blockquote><p>LXXIV</p></blockquote><p>He a free court bids cry; whither his way
Securely every one that wills may wend;
And offers open lists till the ninth day
To whosoever would in arms contend;
And bids build bowers afield, and interlay
Green boughs therein, and flowers and foliage blend;
And make those bowers so gay with silk and gold,
No fairer place this ample world doth hold.</p><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Guested within fair Paris cannot be
The countless foreign bands that thither fare;
Who, rich and poor, of high and low degree,
And Greeks and Latins and Barbarians are.
There is no end of lord and embassy
That thither from all ends of earth repair;
All lodged conveniently, to their content,
Beneath pavilion, booth,</p></div> </div>
