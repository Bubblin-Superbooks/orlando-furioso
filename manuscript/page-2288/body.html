Her shining horn, to guide them on their way;
And on the following morn before them rose
The pleasant shores that round Girgenti lay.
Here Roland orders for the ensuing night
All that is needful for the funeral rite.</pre><h5>CLXVII</h5><pre>He, when he saw his order duly done,

At his invital, to Girgenti went,
— The shore with torches blazing up and down,
And sounding wide with cries and loud lament, —
Thither returned where late, of life bereft,
His friends, beloved in life and death, was left.</pre><h5>CLXVIII</h5><pre class="  ">There stands Bardino, weeping o'er the bier,
Who under Age's heavy burden bows;
