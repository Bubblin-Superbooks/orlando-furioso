Borne to a distance from their native sky.
But more to say were needless, since displaid
To the whole world has been their history.
Though the author has the father's name mis-said;

Of warriors waged at both the ladies' prayer.</pre><h5>LXXIV</h5><pre>Though it was noon in the happy islands, day

When to the fort Orrilo took his way.
Since both the sable sister and the white
Were pleased the furious battle to defer,
Till a new sun should in the horizon stir.</pre></div> </div>
