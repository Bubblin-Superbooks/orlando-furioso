Angelica, in her (if known not scan, ) 

The lofty daughter of Catay's great khan.</pre><h5>XVIII</h5><pre>Angelica, when she had won again
The ring Brunello had from her conveyed,
So waxed in stubborn pride and haught disdain,
She seemed to scorn this ample world, and strayed
Alone, and held as cheap each living swain,
Although, amid the best, by Fame arrayed:
Nor brooked she to remember a galant
In Count Orlando or king Sacripant;</pre><h5>XIX</h5><pre class="  ">And above every other deed repented,
That good Rinaldo she had loved of yore;
And that to look so low she had consented,
(As by such choice dishonoured grieved her sore. )
