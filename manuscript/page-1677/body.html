For yet to her the tidings were unknown,
That good Rinaldo and his bold array
Had raised, with Charles' and Malagigi's aid,
The siege the paynims had to Paris laid.</pre><h5>L</h5><pre>— Cadurci, and Cahors city left behind —
Bradamant sees the mountain, far and near,
Whence Dordogne's waters to the valley wind;
And Montferrant's and Clermont's towers appear:
When she, a lady fair, of semblance kind,
Beholds, by that same road, towards her steer.
Three knights were nigh, and — at the pommel hung —
A buckler from the damsel's saddle swung.</pre><h5>LI</h5><pre class="  ">Before the lady and behind her ride
More squires and maids, a numerous company.
