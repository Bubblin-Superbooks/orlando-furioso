And in an instant from her project ceased;
And deemed, without more debt to count or king,
In place of either knight sufficed the ring.</pre><h5>XXXVI</h5><pre>In haste, they through the forest, here and there,
So scorned of her, still gaze with stupid face;
Like questing hound which loses sight of hare
Or fox, of whom he late pursued the trace,
Into close thicket, ditch, or narrow lair,
Escaping from the keen pursuer's chase.
Meantime their ways the wanton Indian queen
Observes, and at their wonder laughs unseen.</pre><h5>XXXVII</h5><pre class="  ">In the mid wood, where they the maid did lose,
Was but a single pathway, left or right;
Which they believed the damsel could not choose
But follow, when she vanished from their sight.
