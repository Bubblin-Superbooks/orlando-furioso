Speedily all his foemen are in flight.
And when before they came at furious rate,
They hoped to swallow quick the single knight.
None is there who, in that unhappy straight,
Stops for his comrade, flying from the fight.
Here one man speeds afoot, one gallops there;
None stays to question if the road be fair.</pre><h5>LXXXII</h5><pre>His mirror Valour bore about, and here

None looked therein, except an aged peer,
Whose blood was chilled, but courage unreprest.

Than life in flight, and in disgrace possest:
I mean Noritia's king, who lays his lance
In rest against the paladin of France;</pre><h5>LXXXIII</h5></div> </div>
