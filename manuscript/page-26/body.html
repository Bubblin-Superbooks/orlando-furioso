Knew not by which she might her palfrey goad,
(Since both, without distinction, there survey
The recent print of hoofs on either road),
Commit the chase to fortune.  By this way
The paynim pricked, by that Rinaldo strode.
But fierce Ferrau, bewildered in the wood,
Found himself once again where late he stood.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXIV</p></blockquote><pre><code>Beside the water, where he stoop'd to drink,
And dropt the knightly helmet, â€” to his cost,
Sunk in the stream; and since he could not think
Her to retrieve, who late his hopes had crossed.
He, where the treasure fell, descends the brink
Of that swift stream, and seeks the morion lost.
But the casque lies so bedded in the sands,
'Twill ask no light endeavour at his hands.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
