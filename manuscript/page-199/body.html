<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Beyond the city, fought upon accord,
Between Lurcanio and a stranger knight;
Where, on a spacious meadow's level sward,
The pair already had begun the fight.
The porter opened to Mount Alban's lord,
And straight behind the peer the portal hight.
Rinaldo through the empty city rode,
But in a hostel first the dame bestowed:</p><blockquote><p>LXXX</p></blockquote><p>And will that she (he will not long delay
To seek her there till his return repose; )</p><p>And quickly to the lists pursued his way,
Where the two made that fell exchange of blows,
And strove and struggled yet in bloody fray.
Lurcanio's heart with vengeful hatred glows
Against Geneura; while that other knight
As well maintains the quarrel for her right.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Six knights on foot within the palisade
Stand</p></div> </div>
