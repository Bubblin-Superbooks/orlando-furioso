The sun already in the western flood
Had dipt his gilded wheels, what time the two,
Valiant Rogero and his young compeer,
Victorious issued, of the city clear.</p><blockquote><p>XIX</p></blockquote><p>When now Rogero and the stranger knight,
Clear of the city-gates, the champaigne reach,
The youth repays, with praises infinite,
Rogero in kind mode and cunning speech,
Who him, although unknown, had sought to right,
At risk of life, and prays his name to teach
That he may know to whom his thanks he owed
For such a mighty benefit bestowed.</p><blockquote><p>XX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"The visage of Bradamant I see,
The beauteous features and the beauteous cheer."

I of her well-known accents do not hear:
Nor such return of thanks appears to be
In place</p></div> </div>
