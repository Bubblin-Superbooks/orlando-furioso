<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">move,
Who cannot with its lord his prowess prove!'</p><blockquote><p>LVIII</p></blockquote><p>Zerbino having done the pious deed,
Is bowning him to climb his horse; when, lo!
The Tartar king arrives upon the mead.
He, at the trophied pine-tree's gorgeous show,
Beseeches him the cause of this to read;
Who lets him (as rehearsed the story know. )</p><p>When, without further pause, the paynim lord
Hastes gladly to the pine, and takes the sword.</p><blockquote><p>LIX</p></blockquote><p>"None can (he said the action reprehend, )</p><p>Nor first I make the faulchion mine today;
And to its just possession I pretend
Where'er I find it, be it where it may.
Orlando, this not daring to defend,
Has feigned him mad, and cast the sword away;
But if the champion so excuse his shame,
This is no cause I should forego my claim.</p><blockquote><p>LX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
