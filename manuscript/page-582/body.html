That the English had already passed the sea;
And he bade Garbo's aged king appear,
Marsilius, and his heads of chivalry:
Who all advised the monarch to prepare
For the assault of Paris.  They may be
Assured they in the storm will never thrive,
Unless 'tis made before the aids arrive.</p><blockquote><p>LXVII</p></blockquote><p>Innumerable ladders for the scale
Had been collected upon every hand,
And plank and beam, and hurdle's twisted mail,
For different uses, at the king's command;
And bridge and boat; and, what might more avail
Than all the rest, a first and second band
For the assault (so bids the monarch form; )</p><p>Who will himself go forth with them that storm.</p><blockquote><p>LXVIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
