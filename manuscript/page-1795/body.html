With shame all females, that, in evil hour,
Their fortune has conducted to his tower."</p><blockquote><p>XLIV</p></blockquote><p>How in that impious man such fury grew,
Asked young Rogero and those damsels twain,
And prayed she would in courtesy pursue,
Yea, rather from the first her tale explain.
"That castle's lord, fierce, and inhumane,
Yet for a while his wicked heart concealed,
Nor what he was so suddenly revealed.</p><blockquote><p>XLV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
