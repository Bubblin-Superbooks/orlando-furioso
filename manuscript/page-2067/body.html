<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">blow,
A noble townswoman with love of me
Was smit; more sorely smitten none could be.</p><blockquote><p>XXI</p></blockquote><p>"She, in all magic versed, was of such skill
As never was enchantress; by her say
Moved solid earth, and made the sun stand still,
Illumined gloomy night and darkened day:
Yet never could she work upon my will,
With salve I could not give, except with scathe
Of her to whom erewhile I pledged my faith.</p><blockquote><p>XXII</p></blockquote><p>"Not because she right gentle was and bright,
Nor because I believed her love so true,
Nor for large gift, nor promise often plight,
Nor yet because she never ceased to sue,
Could she from me obtain one spark of light
From that first flame my gentle consort blew:
So mates and masters every will in me
The knowledge of my wife's fidelity.</p><blockquote><p>XXIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
