Where the fierce Pagan in his clutch had prest
Proud Paris, and they reached the river strand,
Exactly as the felon swam to land.</pre><h5>XXXII</h5><pre>As soon as the redoubted Rodomont
Knew in the dwarf the courier of his dame,
He all his rage extinguished, cleared his front,
And felt his courage brighten into flame.
All else he deems the courier may recount,
Save that a wight had wrought him scaith and shame,
And cries (encountering him with chearful brow)
"How fares our lady?  wither sent art thou?"</pre><h5>XXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">"Nor mine nor thine that lady will I say,
Who is another's thrall," the dwarf replied.
"We, on our road, encountered yesterday
A knight, who seized and bore away the bride."
