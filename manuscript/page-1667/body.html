Above a month the stripling kept his bed:
And had the stranger here but closed his news,
Well might his tale the missing knight excuse.</pre><h5>XXX</h5><pre>But then subjoins the Gascon cavalier
How in the Moorish camp a damsel lies,
By name Marphisa hight, of beauteous cheer,
Bold and as skilled in arms of every guise,
Who loves Rogero and to him is dear;
And then the host so rarely sundered spies,
That every one, throughout the paynim train,
Deems that betrothed in wedlock are the twain.</pre><h5>XXXI</h5><pre class="  ">And hope, when healed shall be the youthful knight,
The marriage of those lovers will succeed;
(For sure with pleasure and sincere delight, )
