The news from Sicily to Charles were blown,
Sobrino's fate, and death of Brandimart;
Nor less of good Rogero had been shown.
Charles stood with jocund fate and gladsome heart,
Rejoicing he had from his shoulders thrown
The intolerable load whereof the weight
Will for long time prevent his standing straight.</p><blockquote><p>XXVIII</p></blockquote><p>To honour those fair pillars that sustain
The state — the holy empire's corner-stone —

Dispatched, to meet the knights, as far as Saone;
And from his city with his worthiest train,
King, duke, and her, the partner of his throne,
Issued amid a fair and gorgeous band
Of noble damsels, upon either hand.</p><blockquote><p>XXIX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The emperor Charles with bright and cheerful</p></div> </div>
