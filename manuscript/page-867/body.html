And watched his time, and for the harbour ran.

Bade lower the bridge, and issued, horse and man,

Up-stream, till he his way at Antioch ended.</pre><h5>LXXVI</h5><pre>To inform himself of that Martano bent;
And heard that he to Antioch was addrest,
With Origilla, where a tournament
Was to be solemnized by royal hest.

But not by sea again would take his way.</pre><h5>LXXVII</h5><pre class="  ">He towards Lidia and Larissa goes,
