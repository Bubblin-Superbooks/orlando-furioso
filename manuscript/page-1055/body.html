Sir Pinnabel has every hope foregone.
He screaming loud, nor ever making head
Against the damsel, through the forest fled.</p><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote><p>Pale and dismayed his spurs the caitiff plied
Whose last hope of escape in flight was found;

For only to Rogero all attend.</p><blockquote><p>LXXVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The other three, who from the fortress came,

And brought with them the ill-accustomed dame,
Who made wayfarers that ill use obey.
In all (who rather than prolong with blame
Their life, would choose to perish</p></div> </div>
