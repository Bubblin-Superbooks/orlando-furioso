Of promised sweets; since thou art others' prey.
'Twas my design, having with mickle pain
And labour sore, some money put away,
Which I had hoarded out of frequent gain
From parting guests, and from my yearly pay,
To seek again Valencia, and demand
Thee from thy sire in lawful wedlock's band.</p><blockquote><p>LIX</p></blockquote><p>"The damsel shrugs her shoulders, and complains;
And — that he is too late — is her reply.
The Greek laments and sobs, and partly feigns:

Let me, but once, in thine embrace lie!
For every moment in thy presence spent,
Ere thou depart, will make me die</p></div> </div>
