Thou wilt not own her beauty; a device
Put on to masque thy sovereign cowardice.</p><blockquote><p>CXXII</p></blockquote><p>"And of what stamp would be that cavalier
Who found such fair and youthful dame alone,
Without protection, in the forest drear,
Nor sought to make the lovely weft his own?"
â€” "So well she sorts with thee," replied the peer,
" `Twere ill that she were claimed by any one:
Nor I of her would thee in any wise
Deprive; God rest thee merry with thy prize!</p><blockquote><p>CXXIII</p></blockquote><p>"But would thou prove what is my chivalry,
On other ground I to thy wish incline;
Yet deem me not of such perversity
As to tilt with thee for this prize of thine.
Or fair or foul, let her remain thy fee;
I would not, I, such amity disjoin.
Well are ye paired, and safely would I swear
That thou as valiant art as she is fair."</p><blockquote><p>CXXIV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
