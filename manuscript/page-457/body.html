The hawk, which spreads her wings above her nest;
While or and sable he of Worcester wears:
Derby's a dog, a bear is Oxford's crest.
There, as his badge, a cross of chrystal rears
Bath's wealthy prelate, camped among the rest.
The broken seat on dusky field, next scan,
Of Somerset's good duke, Sir Ariman.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXXII</p></blockquote><pre><code>"Forty-two thousand muster in array,
The men at arms and mounted archers there.
By a hundred I misreckon not, or they,
The fighting footmen, twice as many are.
Those ensigns yellow, brown, and green, survey,
And that striped blue and black.  The foot repair
Each to his separate flag where these are spread;
By Godfrey, Henry, Hermant, Edward, led.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXXIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
