Appeared, but pined by melancholy more.</pre><h5>CVII</h5><pre>This was the beldam who had wont to ply
Serving the robbers in the caverned mount;
Whither stern Justice sent (that they might die
By that good paladin Anglante's count. ) 

The aged harridan, for cause which I
To you shall in another place recount,
Now many days by path obscure had flown,
Still fearing lest her visage should be known.</pre><h5>CVIII</h5><pre class="  ">The semblance now of foreign cavalier
She in Marphisa saw, in arms and vest;
And hence she flies not her, though wont to fear,
(As being natives of that land the rest; )
