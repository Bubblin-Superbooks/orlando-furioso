And Guido late so furious? â€” of the two
Young sons of Olivier, that lately wrought
Such deeds in honour of their lineage?  who
Lately a hundred thousand held as nought,
And now, deprived of courage, basely flew,
As ring-doves flutter and as coneys fly,
Who hear some mighty noise resounding nigh.</p><blockquote><p>XCIII</p></blockquote><p>For so to friend as stranger, noxious are
The powers that in the enchanted horn reside.
Sansonet, Guido, follow, with the pair
Or brethren bold, Marphisa terrified.
Nor flying, can they to such distance fare,
But that their ears are dinned.  On every side
Astolpho, on his foaming courser borne,
Lends louder breath to his enchanted horn.</p><blockquote><p>XCIV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
