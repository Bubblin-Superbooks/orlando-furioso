And know, you are assured how evermore
We two have loved; — was never love more true —
Are certain she alone would share my lot;
And are as well assured she loves you not.</pre><h5>XXX</h5><pre>" `Why have not I from you the same respect,
To which, for friendship past, you would pretend
From me; and I should bear you in effect,
If your hope stood more fair to gain its end?
No less than you, to wed her I expect;
And if your fortunes here my wealth transcend,
As favoured of the king, as you, above
You, am I happy in his daughter's love.'</pre><h5>XXXI</h5><pre class="  ">" `Of what a strange mistake,' (to him replied
The duke `your foolish passion is the root! )
