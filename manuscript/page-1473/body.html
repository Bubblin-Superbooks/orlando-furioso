And there at the first inn set-up your rest;
For I must back to Rome without delay;
But trust to overtake you by the way.</pre><h5>XX</h5><pre>" `No other but myself my need could do.

And, what he least believed, within espied;
For he beneath the quilt, his consort true
And chaste, saw sleeping at a stripling's side.
