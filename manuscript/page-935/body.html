And feeling he the sword no more can guide,
Lets himself drop by his Medoro's side.</pre><h5>XVI</h5><pre>The Scots pursue their chief, who pricks before,
Through the deep wood, inspired by high disdain,

A stranger, as it chanced, who lent him aid.</pre><h5>XVII</h5><pre class="  ">By chance arrived a damsel at the place,
Who was (though mean and rustic was her wear)
Of royal presence and of beauteous face,
And lofty manners, sagely debonair:
