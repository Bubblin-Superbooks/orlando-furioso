And drag my bleeding body to his cave."
So saying she her golden hair offends,
And lock by lock the scattered tresses rends.</pre><h5>XXXIV</h5><pre>She to the shore's extremest verge anew,
Tossing her head, with hair dishevelled, run;
And seemed like maid beside herself, and who
Was by ten fiends possessed, instead of one;
Of like the frantic Hecuba, at view
Of murdered Polydore, her infant son;
Fixed on a stone she gazed upon the sea,
Nor less than real stone seemed stone to be.</pre><h5>XXXV</h5><pre class="  ">But let her grieve till my return.  To show
Now of the Child I wish: his weary way
Rogero, in the noon's intensest glow,
Takes by the shore: the burning sunbeams play
