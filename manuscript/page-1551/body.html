The country scowers, to make more spoil and wrack:
That palfrey never more tastes corn or hay;
So that few days exhaust the famished hack.
But not afoot does fierce Orlando stray,
Who will not, while he lives, conveyance lack.

Did mightier scathe than he had done elsewhere;
For now — besides that the infuriate peer
Of all its people left the country bare,
Nor (such the ravage could another year )
