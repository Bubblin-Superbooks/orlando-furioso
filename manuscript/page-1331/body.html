Surpassed all knights that ever girt the sword,
Whose paragon, for heart and prowess tried,
Meseems no ancient histories record,
Cried: "Sacripant, if any one beside
Thyself, to me should utter such a word,
He should deem quickly, from its bitter fruit,
He from his birth would better have been mute.</p><blockquote><p>LXXVI</p></blockquote><p>"But, for that fellowship in which we went,
(As thou hast said together, I to show )</p><p>Such patience and forbearance am content,
As warning thee, thy purpose to forego,
Until thou shalt have witnessed the event
Of strife between me and my Tartar foe:
When him I such example hope to make,
That thou shalt humbly say, `The courser take.' "</p><blockquote><p>LXXVII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
