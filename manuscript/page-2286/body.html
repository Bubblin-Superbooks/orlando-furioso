Bless the good fortune which their hope repayed,
Seeing that valiant warrior, and fall down
Before his feet, and him in humble speech
Again to seek their Bulgary beseech;</p><blockquote><p>LXX</p></blockquote><p>Where kept for him in Adrianople are
The sceptre and the crown, his royal due:
But let him succour to his kingdom bear;
For — to their further scathe — advices shew
Constantine doth a mighty host prepare,
And thitherward in person moves anew;
And they — of their elected king possest —
Hope the Greek empire from his hands to wrest.</p><blockquote><p>LXXI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">He accepts the realm, by their entreaties won;
And, to afford them aid against their foes,
Will went to Bulgary when three months are done;
Save Fortune otherwise of him dispose.
