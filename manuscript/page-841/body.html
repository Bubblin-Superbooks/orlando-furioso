Before the bloody carnage stank to heaven;
And he, with better counsel, from the side
Cast himself down into Seine's foaming tide.</pre><h5>XXIV</h5><pre>Athwart the current swam, with arms and all,
As if by corks upborn, the cavalier.
Though thou Antaeus bred'st, and Hannibal,
O Africa!  thou never bred'st his peer! —
When now across the stream, without the wall,
He turned, and saw the royal town appear,
— To have traversed all the city moved his ire,
Leaving it undestroyed by sword or fire;</pre><h5>XXV</h5><pre class="  ">And him so sorely anger stung and pride,
Thither he thought a second time to go;
And from his inmost bosom groaned and sighed,
Nor would depart until he laid it low.
