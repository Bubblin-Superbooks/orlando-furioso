Might well have wept away his eyes and brows:
Upbraiding skies and stars, the cavalier,
Like lion, in whose veins a fever glows,
Roars as he wreathes his wayward hands within
His hoary hair, and rends his wrinkled skin.</pre><h5>CLXIX</h5><pre>Upon the paladin's return the cry

And speechless stood awhile, his friends to view,
Pale, as at eve is the acanthus' dye
Or lily's, which were plucked at morn: he drew
A heavy sigh, and on the warrior dead
Fixing his stedfast eyes, the County said:</pre><h5>CLXX</h5><pre class="  ">"O comrade bold and true, there here liest slain,
And who dost live in heaven above, I know,
