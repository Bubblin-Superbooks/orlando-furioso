Doralice, daughter to Grenada's king;</pre><h5>CXV</h5><pre>Whom Mandricardo took, as I before
Related, and from whom, and in what wise.
Even she it was, whom Sarza's monarch more
Loved than his realm, — beyond his very eyes:
And valour showed for her and courteous lore,
Not knowing yet she was another's prize.
If he had, — then, — then, first, — the story known,
Even what he did that day, he would have done.</pre><h5>CXVI</h5><pre class="  ">At once the foes a thousand ladders rear.
Against the wall by the assailants shored,
Two mannered each round; the second, in the rear,
Urged on by the first; the third the second gored.
One mounts the wall through valour, one through fear,
And all attempt perforce the dangerous ford;
