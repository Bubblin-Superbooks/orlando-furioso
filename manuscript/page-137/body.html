(So was his image on her mind impressed),
And asks him whence he came, and whither bound;
And he replies and lies, as he is pressed.
The dame, who is forewarned, and knows her ground,
Feigns too as well as he, and lies her best:
And changes sex and sect, and name and land,
And her quick eye oft glances at his hand;</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXVII</p></blockquote><pre><code>Oft glances at his resless hand, in fear
That he might undetected make some prize;
Nor ever lets the knave approach too near,
Well knowing his condition: In this guise
The couple stand together, when they hear
A sudden sound:  but what that sound implies
I, sir, shall tell hereafter with its cause;
But first shall break my song with fitting pause.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
