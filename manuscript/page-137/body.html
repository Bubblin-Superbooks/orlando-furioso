Yet she her blows discharges at the wind;
And spurring here and there prolongs the fight.

And by the magic light, astonished, throw.</p><blockquote><p>XXII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The shield might have been shown at first, nor he

But that he loved some master-stroke to see,
Achieved by lance or sword</p></div> </div>
