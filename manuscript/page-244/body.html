Of spirit, pent beneath the knotty rind,
To your fair leaf and living body I
Have done this scathe and outrage undesigned.
But not the less for that, to me reply,
What art thou, who, in rugged case confined,
Dost live and speak?  And so may never hail
From angry heaven your gentle boughs assail!</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXI</p></blockquote><pre><code>"And if I now or ever the despite
I did thee can repair, or aid impart,
I, by that lady dear, my promise plight,
Who in her keeping has my better part,
To strive with word and deed, till thou requite
The service done with praise and grateful heart."
Rogero said; and, as he closed his suit,
That gentle myrtle shook from top to root.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
