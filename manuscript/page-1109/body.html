<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">he'd stop the courser, chafes him more.</p><blockquote><p>XC</p></blockquote><p>Not looking to his feet, by high or low,
The beast of craven kind, with headlong force
Three miles in rings had gone, and more would go,
But that into a fosse which stopt their course,
Not lined with featherbed or quilt below,
Tumble, reversed, the rider and his horse.
On the hard ground was Mandricardo thrown,
Yet neither spoiled himself, nor broke a bone:</p><blockquote><p>XCI</p></blockquote><p>Here stopt the horse; but him he could not guide,
Left without bit his motions to restrain.
Brimfull of rage and choler, at his side,
The Tartar held him, grappled by the mane.
"Put upon him" (to Mandricardo cried
His lady, Doralice "my hackney's rein, )</p><p>Since for the bridle I have little use;
For gentle is my palfrey, reined or loose."</p><blockquote><p>XCII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
