Prepares the costly feast in solemn state;
And will on each fourth moon that shall ensue
Make one, resembling this we celebrate.
Pleased of that time the memory to renew,
That he, in the orc's cavern, had to wait,
— For four months and a day — which is to-morrow;
When he was rescued from such cruel sorrow.</pre><h5>LXVIII</h5><pre>"The things related I in part descried,
And from him, present at the whole, heard more;
From Norandine, through calend and through ide,
Pent, till he changed to smiles his anguish sore:
And if from other you hear aught beside,
Say, he is ill instructed in his lore."
The Syrian gentleman did thus display
The occasion of that feast and fair array.</pre><h5>LXIX</h5></div> </div>
