Deep under earth, extends a gloomy cell.
The surest pass for him, as they repeat,
That would at any time descend to hell.
Hither the predatory troop retreat,
As a safe refuge from the deafening yell.
As far, and farther than Cocytus' shore
Descending, till that horn is heard no more.</pre><h5>CXXVIII</h5><pre>At that dark hellish inlet, which a way
Opens to him who would abandon light,
The terrifying bugle ceased to bray;
— The courser furled his wings and stopt his flight.
But, ere Astolpho further I convey,
— Not to depart from my accustomed rite —
Since on all sides the paper overflows,</pre><blockquote><p>Canto and repose.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
