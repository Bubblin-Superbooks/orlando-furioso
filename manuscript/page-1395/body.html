(Stanzas LXXIX - LXXXIII untranslated by Rose)</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIV</p></blockquote><p>So reasoning, that just elder and sincere,
With ready instances, supports his creed;
Showing there many women are who ne'er
Sinned against chastity, in word or deed:
But him with impious visage and severe
The paynim scared, ill pleased the truth to read.
So that, through fear, he further speech forbore,
But changed not therefore aught his former lore.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Having stopt further question in this wise,
The paynim monarch from the table rose:
Then lays him on his bed, till from the skies
The dusky shades depart, and morning glows:
But spends a larger part of night in sighs
At his liege-lady's sin, than in repose.
