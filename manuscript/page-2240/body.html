Ah!  if I will not bear this injury
Without revenge, against whom shall I turn?

That hath inflicted on me scathe and scorn.

Done to myself, against myself must arm.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVIII</p></blockquote><p>"Yet was but to myself this injury done,

But Bradamant, is done this injury;
Even if I could consent myself to spare,
It fits me not unvenged to leave that fair.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIX</p></blockquote><p>"Then I the damsel will avenge, and die,
