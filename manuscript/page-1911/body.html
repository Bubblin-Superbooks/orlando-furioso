Makes for Valentia; where he town and tower
Begins to fortify with mickle pain;
And for that war prepares, which after ends
In the destruction of himself and friends.</p><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote><p>King Agramant his sails for Africk bent:
His barks ill-armed and almost empty go;
Empty of men, but full of discontent,
In that three-fourths had perished by the foe.
As cruel some, as weak and proud some shent
Their king, and (as still happens in like woe)
All hate him privily; but, for they fear
His fury, in his presence mute appear.</p><blockquote><p>LXXVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Yet sometimes two or three their lips unclose,
— Some knot of friends, where each on each relies —
And their pent choler and their rage expose:
Yet Agramant beneath the illusion lies,
That each will love and pity</p></div> </div>
