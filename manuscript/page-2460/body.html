To Proteus the pavilion gave away;
Which, passing through the line of Ptolemy,
To Cleopatra fell; from her in fray
Agrippa's band on the Leucadian sea
Bore off the treasure, amid other prey.

Kept till the time of Constantine in Rome:</pre><h5>LXXXIV</h5><pre>That Constantine, whom thou shall ever rue
Fair Italy, while the heavens above are rolled.

Weary of Tyber, bore the tent of old.

Its pole of ivory and its cord of gold,
And all its cloth with beauteous figures fraught;
Fairer Apelles' pencil never wrought.</pre><h5>LXXXV</h5></div> </div>
