A gilded roof, which with enamelled dyes
Was stained below, the building overlayed.
Eight marble statues (snowy was the grain),
With the left arm that gilded roof sustain.</pre><h5>LXXX</h5><pre>Fair Amalthaea's horn in the right hand
Had quaintly sculptured the ingenious master,
Whence water, trickling forth with murmur bland,
Descends into a vase of alabaster;
And he, in likeness of a lady grand,
With sovereign art had fashioned each pilaster.

But all of equal charms and grace possest.</pre><h5>LXXXI</h5><pre class="  ">Upon two beauteous images below
Each of these female statues fix their feet.
