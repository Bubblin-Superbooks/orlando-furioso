(Beyond all modern instance raised on high, ) 

To shine with endless glory in the sky.</pre><h5>X</h5><pre>My ladies of Ferrara, those of gay
Urbino's court are here; and I descry
Mantua's dames, and all that fair array
Which Lombardy and Tuscan town supply.
The cavalier amid that band, whom they
So honour, unless dazzled is mine eye
By those fair faces, is the shining light
Of his Arezzo, and Accolti hight.</pre><h5>XI</h5><pre class="  ">Adorned with scarlet hat, and scarlet pall,
His nephew Benedict, lo!  there I see;
With him Campeggio and Mantua's cardinal;
Glory and light of the consistory;
