Were the bright tresses which the hermit shore,
These, gathered in a knot, behind her head,
Though shorter than their wont, the damsel wore;
And he, that castle's master, plainly read,

Seated about the fire, they feed the ear;

By whom begun, and how it took its rise?
And thus that castellain to her replies.</pre><h5>LXXXIII</h5></div> </div>
