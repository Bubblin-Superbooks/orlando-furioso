Whom he had hoped to find upon the quay;
He turns and gazes round the desert strand,
And none is there — directs along the bay
His eyes, and now, far distant from the land,
Beholds the parting frigate under way.
So that the paladin, for his escape —
The vessel gone — must other project shape.</pre><h5>XCVIII</h5><pre class="  ">Let him depart!  nor let it trouble you
That he so long a road must beat alone;
Where, never without fear, man journeys through
Wild paynim countries: danger is there none,
But what he with his bugle may eschew,
Whose dread effect the English duke has shown;
And let his late companions be our care,
</pre></div> </div>
