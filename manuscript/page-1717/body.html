And on Rialto's shore his battle post.
Then fly and leave his drowning bands behind,
His bridge destroyed by wasting waves and wind.</pre><h5>XVIII</h5><pre>"Burgundian Lewis ye behold descend
Thither with his invading squadrons, where,
Vanquishing and taken, nevermore to offend
With hostile arms, he is compelled to swear.

Anew, with reckless steps, into the snare.

Blind as the moldwarp, hence their lord convey.</pre><h5>XIX</h5><pre class="  ">"You see him named from Arles, victorious Hugh,
From Italy the Berengari chase!

Now the Bavarians, now the Huns, replace.
