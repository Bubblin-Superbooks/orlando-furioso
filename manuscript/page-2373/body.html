Arraigned of fickleness, as full of truth;</pre><h5>XXX</h5><pre>And her reproves for having lent an ear
To a suspicion so unjust and blind;
And so, this thought absolves the cavalier;
And that accuses; and both audience find;
And now this way, now that, she seemed to veer;
Nor this, nor that — irresolute of mind —
Preferred: yet still to what gave most delight
Most promptly leaned, and loathed its opposite;</pre><h5>XXXI</h5><pre class="  ">And thinking, ever and anon, anew
On that so oft repeated by the knight,
As for grave sin, remorse and sorrow grew
That she had nursed suspicion and affright;
And she, as her Rogero were in view,
Would blame herself, and would her bosom smite;
