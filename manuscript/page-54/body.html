The maid no sooner had Rinaldo spied,
Than on her laughing eyes deep darkness sate:
And with sad mien and trembling voice she cried
To Sacripant, and prayed him not to wait
The near approach of the detested knight,

And that dread night I singly stood for thee?
That night when I, though naked, was thy shield
Against King Agrican and all his field?"</pre><h5>LXXXI</h5><pre class="  ">She answers not, and knows not in her fear
