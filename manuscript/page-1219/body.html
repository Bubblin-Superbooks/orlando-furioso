Horses and oxen slew, his helpless prey;
And well the courser ran who 'scaped that day.</pre><h5>VIII</h5><pre>Already might'st thou hear how loudly ring
The hubbub and the din, from neighbouring farms,
Outcry and horn, and rustic trumpeting;
And faster sound of bells; with various arms
By thousands, with spontoon, bow, spit, and sling.
Lo!  from the hills the rough militia swarms.
As many peasants from the vale below,
To make rude war upon the madman go,</pre><h5>IX</h5><pre class="  ">As beats the wave upon the salt-sea shore,
Sportive at first, which southern wind has stirred,
When the next, bigger than what went before,
And bigger than the second, breaks the third;
And the vext water waxes evermore,
