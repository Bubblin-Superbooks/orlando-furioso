Left my good squadrons masterless, to ride
Along the cliffs, and passes least forlorn;
And took the way (love served me for a guide)
Where it appeared the ruthless thief had born,
Ascending to his den, the lovely prey,
What time he snatched my hope and peace away.</p><blockquote><p>XLI</p></blockquote><p>"Six days I rode, from morn to setting sun,
By horrid cliff, by bottom dark and drear;
And giddy precipice, where path was none,
Nor sign, nor vestiges of man were near.
At last a dark and barren vale I won,
Where caverned mountains and rude cliffs appear;
Where in the middle rose a rugged block,
With a fair castle planted on the rock.</p><blockquote><p>XLII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"From far it shone like flame, and seemed not dight
Of marble or of brick; and in my eye
More wonderful</p></div> </div>
