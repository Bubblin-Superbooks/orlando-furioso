Of followers, far and wide, through every bourn,
And afterwards, in person went in vain,
To find the warrior of the unicorn.
The wise enchantress, that will sell and rein,
Had on that day equipt a demon, borne
By him, in likeness of a hackney horse,
Constantine's son encountered in her course.</p><blockquote><p>XXIII</p></blockquote><p>"If such as your ingenuous mien" (she cried
To Leo "is your soul's nobility, )</p><p>And corresponding with your fair outside
Your inward goodness and your courtesy,
Some help, some comfort, sir, for one provide
In whom the best of living knights we see;
Who, save ye help and comfort quickly lend,
Is little distant from his latter end.</p><blockquote><p>XXIV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
