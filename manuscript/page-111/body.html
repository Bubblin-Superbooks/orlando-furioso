Whose trophies shall so many fanes array.
Hugh, the bold son, is with the sire, and he
Shall conquer Milan, and the snakes display.
Azo, that next approaching form shall be,
And, his good brother dead, the Insubri sway.
Lo!  Albertazo!  by whose rede undone,
See Berengarius banished, and his son.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXVII</p></blockquote><pre><code>"With him shall the imperial Otho join
In wedlock worthily his daughter fair.
And lo!  another Hugh!  O noble line!
O!  sire succeeded by an equal heir!
He, thwarting with just cause their ill design,
Shall thrash the Romans' pride who overbear;
Shall from their hands the sovereign pontiff take,
With the third Otho, and their leaguer break.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXVIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
