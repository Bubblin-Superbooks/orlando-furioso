The wind blows fair, and on the starboard hand,
Not widely distant from them, lies that land.</p><blockquote><p>CLXVI</p></blockquote><p>With a fresh wind, that in their favour blows,
They loose their hawser at the close of day:
In heaven above the silent goddess shows
Her shining horn, to guide them on their way;
And on the following morn before them rose
The pleasant shores that round Girgenti lay.
Here Roland orders for the ensuing night
All that is needful for the funeral rite.</p><blockquote><p>CLXVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">He, when he saw his order duly done,
And now the westering sun's fair light was spent.
With many nobles, who from neighbouring town,
At his invital, to Girgenti went,
— The shore with torches blazing up and down,
And sounding wide with cries and loud lament, —
Thither returned where late, of life</p></div> </div>
