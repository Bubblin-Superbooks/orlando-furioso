Ere on his right he heard a mighty din.</pre><h5>XVI</h5><pre>He heard a din, and fearful clashing sound
Of arms, and hurrying on with eager pace
'Twixt tree and tree, two furious champions found,
Waging fierce fight in close and straightened place:
Who to each other (warring on what ground
I know not neither showed regard nor grace. ) 

The one a giant was of haughty cheer,
And one a bold and gallant cavalier.</pre><h5>XVII</h5><pre class="  ">Covered with shield and sword, one, leaping, sped
Now here now there, and thus himself defended,
Lest a two-handed mace upon his head
Should fall, with which the giant still offended: â€”
On the field lay his horse, already dead.
