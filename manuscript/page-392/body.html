For so was the expecting lady hight,
To whom that island's crown belonged of right.</pre><h5>LXXXV</h5><pre>She who had thither good Orlando brought,
Not hoping that he would have thriven so well;
— Enough for her, if by her misery bought,
Her spouse were rescued from the tyrant's cell! —
Her, full of love and loyal homage, sought
The people one and all:  Twere long to tell
How she caressed Bireno, he the maid, —
What thanks both lovers to the county paid.</pre><h5>LXXXVI</h5><pre class="  ">The people, throned in her paternal reign,
Replace the injured dame, and fealty swear:
She on the duke, to whom in solid chain
Love with eternal knot had linked the fair,
The empire of herself and her domain
