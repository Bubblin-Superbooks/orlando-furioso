And hope, that putting on myself this cheat,
I in short time shall quench my amorous heat.'</pre><h5>XXVI</h5><pre>"So said the knight; and I, who was distraught,
And all beside myself, was not aware
That the design, in which he help besought,
Was manifestly but too foul a snare;
And in Geneura's clothes disguised, as taught,
Let down (so oft I used the corded stair. ) 

Nor I the traitor's foul deceit perceived,
Until the deadly mischief was achieved.</pre><h5>XXVII</h5><pre class="  ">"The duke, this while, to Ariodantes' ears
Had these, or other words like these, addressed;
(For leagued in friendship were the cavaliers,
Till, rivals, they pursued this common quest)
