To spur him to a new career again
Now thought; but doubted next, in fear to fare
Worse on the courser, restive to the rein.
"No, I will win by force the mountain stair,"
Rogero said; (but the resolve was vain)
Nor by the beach two miles his way pursued,
Ere he Alcina's lovely city viewed.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LIX</p></blockquote><pre><code>A lofty wall at distance meets his eye

And all appears like gold from top to ground.

— And haply his opinion is unsound —
And haply he more wittily divines:
For me, I deem it gold because it shines.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
