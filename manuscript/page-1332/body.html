Half dropt on this, and half on the other side.</pre><h5>XXII</h5><pre>With the same downright stroke, he overbore
The horse and rider, bleeding in the dust;
The heads of others from their shoulders bore,
And parted from the hips the bleeding bust.
He often at a blow cleft five and more;
And — but I doubt who hears me might distrust
What of a seeming falsehood bears the impress —
I would say more; but I parforce say less.</pre><h5>XXIII</h5><pre class="  ">Good Turpin, he who knows that he tells true,
And leaves men to believe what they think right,
Says of Rogero wondrous things, which you
Hearing related, would as falsehoods slight.
Thus, with Marphisa matched, that hostile crew
Appears like ice, and she like burning light.
