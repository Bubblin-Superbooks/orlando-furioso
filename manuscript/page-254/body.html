<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h5>LXVIII</h5><pre>This as it may: the Child would meet his fate,
Ere by so vile a band be prisoner led;
When, lo!  forth issuing from the city's gate,
Whose wall appeared like shining gold I said,
Two youthful dames, not born in low estate,
If measured by their mien and garb, nor bred
By swain, in early wants and troubles versed;
But amid princely joys in palace nursed!</pre><h5>LXIX</h5><pre>On unicorn was seated either fair,
A beast than spotless ermine yet more white;
So lovely were the damsels, and so rare
Their garb, and with such graceful fashion dight,
That he who closely viewed the youthful pair,
Would need a surer sense than mortal sight,
To judge between the two.  With such a mien
Embodied Grace and Beauty would be seen.</pre></div> </div>
