"Right ill advice to thee Melissa brought,
Who moved three thus to anger wasps; and I
Perceive in thee small wisdom, that wouldst sound
A thing which thou wouldst gladly not have found.</pre><h5>XLVIII</h5><pre>"If she, thy wife, by avarice was inclined
To break her faith and be to thee untrue,

And by a meaner bribe yet firmer mind
Is even tempted fouler deed to do.

Their patrons and their friends for sordid gold?</pre><h5>XLIX</h5><pre class="  ">"With such fierce arms thou ill didst her assail,
If to behold a brave defence thou sought.
