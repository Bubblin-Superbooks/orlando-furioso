So far Orlando wends, he comes to where
He of old Proteus' hears the cruel use
But feels such pity for Olympia fair,
Wronged by Cymosco, who in prison mews
Her plighted spouse, that ere he makes repair
Further, he gives her hope to venge the abuse:
He does so, and departs; and with his spouse
Departs Bireno, to repeat his vows.</p><blockquote><p>I</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">What cannot, when he has a heart possess'd
This false and cruel traitor Love?  since he
Can banish from Orlando's faithful breast
Such tried allegiance and due</p></div> </div>
