And Lydian — as that paladin was taught —
Grecian and Persian, all of ancient fame;
And now, alas!  well-nigh without a name.</p><blockquote><p>LXXVII</p></blockquote><p>Golden and silver hooks to sight succeed,
Heaped in a mass, the gifts which courtiers bear,
— Hoping thereby to purchase future meed —
To greedy prince and patron; many a snare,
Concealed in garlands, did the warrior heed,
Who heard, these signs of adulation were;
And in cicalas, which their lungs had burst,
Saw fulsome lays by venal poets versed.</p><blockquote><p>LXXVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Loves of unhappy end in imagery

Then eagles' talons, the authority
With which great lords their delegates invest:
Bellows filled every nook, the fume and fee
Wherein the favourites of kings are blest:
Given to those Ganymedes</p></div> </div>
