The gift, and of the fairy took his leave.</pre><h5>XVI</h5><pre>Quitting the port and smoother waves, they stand
To sea, with favouring wind which blows astern;
And (coasting round the rich and populous land ) 

Of odoriferous Ind the vessels turn,
Opening a thousand isles on either hand,
Scattered about that sea, till they discern
The land of Thomas; here the pilot veers
His ready tiller, and more northward steers.</pre><h5>XVII</h5><pre class="  ">Astolpho, furrowing that ocean hoar,
Marks, as he coasts, the wealthy land at ease.
Ganges amid the whitening waters roar,
Nigh skirting now the golden Chersonese;
Taprobana with Cori next, and sees
