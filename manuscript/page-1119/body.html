Who, on a day, as with the count she went,
I know not whither, by a knight was shent.</pre><h5>L</h5><pre>"This knight, as flouted by that bonnibel,
For carrying on his croup an ancient dame,
Encountered with her champion Pinnabel,
Of overweening pride and little fame:
Him he o'erturned, made alight as well,
And put her to the proof, if sound or lame;
â€” Left her on foot, and had that woman old
In the dismounted damsel's garment stoled.</pre><h5>LI</h5><pre class="  ">"She, who remained on foot, in fell despite,
Greedy of vengeance, and athirst for ill,
Leagued with the faithless Pinnabel, a wight
All evil prompt to further and fulfil,
Says she shall never rest by day nor night,
