So that he kill ten champions in the fray,
A hundred women's cry, whose lords will bleed
Beneath his falchion, shall your ears dismay.
Let him not 'scape by such a murderous deed;
But, if he would, propound some other way.
â€” Yet if he of those ten supply the place,
And please a hundred women, grant him grace.'</pre><h5>LIV</h5><pre>"This was severe Artemia's sentiment,
(So was she named and had her counsel weighed, ) 

Elbanio to the temple had been sent,
To perish by the sacrificial blade.
But Orontea, willing to content
Her daughter, to the matron answer made;
And urged so many reasons, and so wrought,
The yielding senate granted what she ought.</pre></div> </div>
