Their glory, that eternal fame inherit:</p><blockquote><p>VI</p></blockquote><p>Faithful, chaste, and bold, the world hath seen
In Greece and Rome not only, but where'er
The Sun unfolds his flowing locks, between

And this because they in their days have had
For chroniclers, men envious, false, and bad.</p><blockquote><p>VII</p></blockquote><p>But ye that prosper in the exercise
Of goodly labours, aye your way pursue;
Nor halt, O women, in your high emprise,

For, as nought good endures beneath the skies,
So ill endures no more; if hitherto
Unfriendly by the poet's pen and page,
They now befriend you in our better age.</p><blockquote><p>VIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
