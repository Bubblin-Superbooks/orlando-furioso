When fifteen days or twenty were gone by:
So had he after to Hippalca sworn,
Bidding her boldly on his faith rely.
"From accidents that chance at every turn"
(Cried Bradamant "what warranty have I, ) 

Alas! — and such are commonest in war —
That none the knight's return for ever bar?

`    LXXXII
"Alas!  alas!  Rogero, that above
Myself hast evermore been prized by me,
Who would have thought thou more than me could'st love
Any, and most thy mortal enemy?
