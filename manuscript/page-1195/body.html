This, and whatever else he should command.
By different ways the cavaliers withdrew,
One on the right, and one on the left hand.

The Tartar's charger had pursued astray,
Made Roland for two days, with fruitless pain,

On either bank of which a meadow lay;
Which, stained with native hues and rich, he sees,
And dotted o'er with fair and many trees.</pre><h5>CI</h5></div> </div>
