Forth from the ramparts, at the monarch's call.
With them Rogero goes, in armour cased,
Balked of the battle by Marphisa's haste.</pre><h5>XXVI</h5><pre>The enamoured youth, with beating heart, intent,
Stood by, the issue of the just to view.
For his dear cousin fearing the event,

At the first onset, like the justs whilere,
Misdoubting some strange accident, in sprite,
