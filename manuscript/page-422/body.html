It is in pity, is in goodness done:
Since to raise up and comfort in distress
Whom Fortune's wheel beats down in changeful run,
Was never blamed; with glory oftener paid;
— So much the more, a young — a harmless maid.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XV</p></blockquote><pre><code>Almighty God!  how fallible and vain
Is human judgment, dimmed by clouds obscure!

By others are reputed just and pure.
Already stooping to their oars, the train
Have loosed his vessel from the port secure,
And with the duke and his companions steer
For Zealand through the deep, with meery cheer.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XVI</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>Already Holland and its headlands</pre></div> </div>
