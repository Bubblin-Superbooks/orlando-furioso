You here may in the mortal body share."
So speaking, and yet distant from the shore,
To the safe bank approached the pilot hoar.</pre><h5>XLVIII</h5><pre>When he beholds forth-issuing from the strand,
A fleet of ships, which all towards him steer.
With these came wronged Alcina, with a band
Of many vassals, gathered far and near;
To risk the ruin of herself and land,
Or repossess the thing she held so dear.
Love, no light cause, incites the dame aggrieved,
Nor less the bitter injury received.</pre><h5>XLIX</h5><pre class="  ">Such choler she had never felt before
As that which now upon her bosom fed:
And hence she made her followers ply the oar
Till the white foam on either bank was shed
