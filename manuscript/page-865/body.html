That towards Antioch she her way pursues,
By a new leman of that city charmed,

Sir Gryphon of the news to them conveyed,
Who, hearing that he had, surmised the rest, â€”
Where he was gone, and by what motive swayed:

And had in quest of her for Antioch made,
To take her from his rival, and with view
On him some memorable scathe to do.</pre><h5>LXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">Aquilant brooked not Gryphon such a feat,
Without him, and alone, should thus assay,
And took his armour and pursued his beat;
