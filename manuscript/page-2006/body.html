Rich in barbarick pomp, amid that train,
Rode Africk's monarch, ready armed for fight:

Two of his legs were pied, his forehead white
Fast beside Agramant, Rogero came,

The other harness of Rogero bold,
Enriched with precious pearls and rough with gold.</pre><h5>LXXIX</h5><pre class="  ">On the other part, without his camp appears
