They swear, shall be conferred on woman here:</pre><h5>CXVI</h5><pre>Then make them promise never to bestow
Harbourage on whosoever thither sped,
Footman or cavalier, nor even allow
Any beneath a roof to hide his head,
Unless he swore by God and saints, or vow
Yet stronger made — if stronger could be said —
That he the sex's cause would aye defend,
Foe to their foes, and woman's faithful friend;</pre><h5>CXVII</h5><pre class="  ">And, if he then were wived, or ever were
— Sooner or later — linked in nuptial noose,
Still to his wife he would allegiance bear,
Nor e'er compliance with her will refuse.
Marphisa says, within the year, she there
Will be, and ere the trees their foliage lose;
