Though little, upon which I lived, to buy
Thee needful succour and from prison bear?
Wretch, whither shall I go? — I know not where.</pre><h5>XXXII</h5><pre>"Can I to Friesland go, where I to reign
As queen was called, and this for thee forewent;
Where both my brethren and my sire were slain,
And every other good from me was rent? —
Thee would I not, thou ingrate, with my pain
Reproach, not therefore deal thee punishment:
As well as I, the story dost thou know;
Now, see the meed thou dost for this bestow!</pre><h5>XXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">"Oh!  may I but escape the wild corsair,
Nor taken be, and after sold for slave!
