Than she is cheated by the common show.
Each crooked way or straight her feet explore
Within it and without, above, below;
Nor rests she night or day, so strong the lore
Of the enchanter, who has ordered so,

So it appears that, in the things I tell,
The wider here and there my story ranges,
It will be found less tedious for its changes.</pre></div> </div>
