To Proteus every day should one be led.
Till one should in the Godhead's sight find grace.
The first and all those others slain, who fed,
All a devouring orc, that kept his place
Beside the port, what time into the main
The remnant of the herd retired again.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LVIII</p></blockquote><pre><code>Were the old tale of Proteus' false or true,

The savage, ancient statute, which decreed
That woman's flesh the ravening monster, who
For this came every day to land, should feed.
Though to be woman is a crying ill
In every place, 'tis here a greater still.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LIX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
