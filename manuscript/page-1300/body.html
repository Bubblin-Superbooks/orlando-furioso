Of these, Orlando of his wit bereft,
Naked, in sun or shower, by plain or peak,
Wanders about the world, a helpless weft;
And he, in wisdom little less to seek,
Rinaldo, in thy peril thee has left;
And, for in Paris-town she is not found,
In search of his Angelica is bound.</p><blockquote><p>IX</p></blockquote><p>A cunning, old enchanter him deceived,
As in the outlet of my tale was said:
Deluded by a phantom, he believed
Angelica was with Orlando fled;
And hence with jealousy, at heart, aggrieved
(Lover ne'er suffered worse to Paris sped; )</p><p>Whence he, as soon as he appeared at court,
By chance, was named to Britain to resort.</p><blockquote><p>X</p></blockquote></div> </div>
