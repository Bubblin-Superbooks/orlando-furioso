Had not perchance gainsaid my better right —
Of if he had gainsaid my reasoning,
Who would have taken thee in my despite?
Why not have armed, and rather let them wring
My heart out of my breast?  But not the might
Of Charles or all his host, had they been tried,
Could have availed to tear thee from my side.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote><pre><code>"Oh!  had he placed her but in strong repair,
Guarded in some good fort, or Paris-town!
— Since he would trust her to Duke Namus' care,
That he should lose her in this way, alone
Sorts with my wish. — Who would have kept the fair
Like me, that would for her to death have gone?
Have kept her better than my heart or sight:
Who should and could, yet did not what I might.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXVI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
