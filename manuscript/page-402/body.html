<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Nor, when 'tis taken, more esteems the prize;
And only hurries after that which flies.</pre><h5>VIII</h5><pre>Such is the practise of these striplings who,
What time you treat them with austerity,
Love and revere you, and such homage do,
As those who pay their service faithfully;
But vaunt no sooner victory, than you
From mistresses shall servants grieve to be;
And mourn to see the fickle love they owed,
From you diverted, and elsewhere bestowed.</pre><h5>IX</h5><pre class="  ">I not for this (for that were wrong opine ) 

That you should cease to love; for you, without
A lover, like uncultivated vine,
Would be, that has no prop to wind about.
But the first down I pray you to decline,
