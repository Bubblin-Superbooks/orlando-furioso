<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The cavalier upon the bank descends;
And sits so motionless, so lost in care,
(His visage propt upon his arm to sight ) 

Changed into senseless stone appeared the knight.</pre><h5>XL</h5><pre>Pensive, above an hour, with drooping head,
He rested mute, ere he began his moan;
And then his piteous tale of sorrow said,
Lamenting in so soft and sweet a tone,
He in a tiger's breast had pity bred,
Or with his mournful wailings rent a stone.
And so he sighed and wept; like rivers flowed
His tears, his bosom like an Aetna glowed.</pre><h5>XLI</h5><pre class="  ">"Thought which now makes me burn, now freeze with hate,
Which gnaws my heart and rankles at its root!
