Till he of one could rid him, of the twain,
Who in the boat with us had scaped the main.</pre><h5>XXII</h5><pre>"A man of Scotland he, Almonio hight,
Who to Zerbino seemed great faith to bear;
And as a perfect warrior by the knight,
Praised, when to Odoric given, his trust to share:
To him (the Spaniard said it were a slight ) 

If I unto Rochelle afoot should fare;
And prayed, that he before would thither speed,
And forward thence some hackney, for my need.</pre><h5>XXIII</h5><pre class="  ">"Almonio, who in this suspects no ill,
Forthwith, before our party, wends his way
To the town, hidden by the wooded hill,
And which not more than six miles distant lay.
