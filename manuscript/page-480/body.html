They know not whither, speed, some here, some there.
Orlando draws to land, the billows sweeping,
That horrid fish, but might his labour spare:

The brute, exhausted, died, ere dragged ashore.</pre><h5>XLVI</h5><pre>Of the islanders had trooped no petty throng,
To witness that strange fight, who by a vain
And miserable superstition stung,
Esteemed such holy deed a work profane;
And said that this would be another wrong
To Proteus, and provoke his ire again;
Make him his herds pour forth upon the strand,
And with the whole old warfare vex the land;</pre><h5>XLVII</h5><pre class="  ">And that it better were to sue for peace,
