The unhappy Cretan women more complain,
And fuller tears on this occasion shed,
That if their fathers lay before them dead.</pre><h5>XVIII</h5><pre>"Long time and sorely all the striplings bold
Were, each apart, by them implored to stay:
Who since the fleeting youths they cannot hold,
Leave brother, sire, and son, with these to stray,
Of jewels and of weighty sums of gold
Spoiling their households ere they wend their way,
For so well was the plot concealed, no wight
Throughout all Crete was privy to their flight.</pre><h5>XIX</h5><pre class="  ">"So happy was the hour, so fair the wind,
When young Phalantus chose his time to flee,
They many miles had left the isle behind,
Ere Crete lamented her calamity.
