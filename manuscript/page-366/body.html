In that the gentle warrior was arrayed
In Arab weeds, he this might safely do;
And of his purpose came alike in aid

Revisits, to its farthest little town.
Roves from Provence to Brittany's domain,
And from the Picards to the bounds of Spain.</code></pre><blockquote><p>VII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
