My sire and both my brothers slaughtered were,
My country sacked and waste, as that the knight
I would not wrong, to whom I fealty sware,
And had my solemn word already plight
That me to wedlock man should woo in vain,
Till he to Holland should return from Spain.</pre><h5>XXXIV</h5><pre>"For one ill-born, a hundred yet behind,
Will bear (replied to hazard all content, ) 

— Slain, burnt alive, to let them to the wind
Scatter my ashes, rather than consent. —
My people seek to move my stedfast mind,
By prayer and by protest, from this intent;
And threat to yield my city up and me,
Lest all be lost through my obduracy.</pre><h5>XXXV</h5></div> </div>
