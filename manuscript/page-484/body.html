Was in the forest lost, with wood o'ergrown,

For print of recent footsteps, up and down,
The fierce Ferrau, who might have borne away
From all that ever proudest were, the crown,
With evil countenance, to the other two
Turned him about, and shouted "Whence are you?"</p><blockquote><p>XXXIX</p></blockquote><p>"Turn back or take another road, save here,

Nor when I chase or woo my lady dear,
Let any think I bear with company."

And reel from spindle-staff the matted wool?"</p><blockquote><p>XL</p></blockquote></div> </div>
