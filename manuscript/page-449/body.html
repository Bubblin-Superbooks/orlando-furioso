<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre>Rogero overhand, not in the rest
Carries his lance, and beats, with downright blow,
The monstrous orc.  What this resembled best,
But a huge, writhing mass, I do not know;
Which wore no form of animal exprest,
Save in the head, with eyes and teeth of sow.
His forehead, 'twixt the eyes, Rogero smites,
But as on steel or rock the weapon lights.</pre><h5>CII</h5><pre>When he perceives the first of no avail,
The knight returns to deal a better blow;
The orc, who sees the shifting shadow sail
Of those huge pinions on the sea below,
In furious heat, deserts his sure regale
On shore, to follow that deceitful show:
And rolls and reels behind it, as it fleets.
Rogero drops, and oft the stroke repeats.</pre><h5>CIII</h5></div> </div>
