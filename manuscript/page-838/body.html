Of the orc and of Lucina, erst had heard
In Syria; how she to return once more
In Nicosia, to her lord prepared.

His bark for sea the ready Patron cleared,
Hawled up his anchor, westward turned the head
Of the good ship, and all his canvas spread.</p><blockquote><p>CXLI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">To the north wind, which blew upon their right,

Raised up the sea</p></div> </div>
