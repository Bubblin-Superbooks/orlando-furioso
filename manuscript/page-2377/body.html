<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Return, alas!  return, O radiance dear!
And drive from me that foul, consuming Fear.</pre><h5>XXXVIII</h5><pre>"If the sun turn from us and shorten day,
Earth all its beauties from the sight doth hide;
The wild winds howl, and snows and ice convey;
Bird sings not; nor is leaf or flower espied.
So, whensoever thou thy gladsome ray,
O my fair sun, from me dost turn aside,
A thousand, and all evil, dreads, make drear
Winter within me many times a year.</pre><h5>XXXIX</h5><pre class="  ">"Return, my sun, return!  and springtide sweet,
Which evermore I long to see, bring back;
Dislodge the snows and ice with genial hear;
And clear my mind, so clouded o'er and black."
As Philomel, or Progne, with the meat
Returning, which her famished younglings lack,
