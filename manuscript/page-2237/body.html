Related; how of all that he had tried,
Who of his goblet drank, there was no wight
But split the wine he to his lips would guide.
Now he repents him; now, "'Tis my delight,"
(Mutters "that I the proof would not abide: ) 

Succeeding I should prove but what I thought;
And not succeeding, to what pass am brought!</pre><h5>LXVI</h5><pre>"This my belief I deem a certainty;
And faith could have but small increase in me:
So, if I this should by the touchstone try,
My present good would little bettered be:
But small the evil would not prove, if I
Saw of my Clarice what I would not see.
This were a thousand against one to stake;
To hazard much where I could nothing take."</pre></div> </div>
