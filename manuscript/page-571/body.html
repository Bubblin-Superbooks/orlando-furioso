A face so gentle and so passing fair?"</code></pre><blockquote><p>XCIV</p></blockquote><pre><code>With pain the virgin to the count replies,
As he inquires of her unhappy doom,
In sweet and broken accents, which by sighs
Impelled, through rows of pearl and coral come:
And between rose and lily, from her eyes
Tears fall so fast, she needs must swallow some.
In other canto, sir, be pleased to attend
The rest, for here 'tis time my strain should end.</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
