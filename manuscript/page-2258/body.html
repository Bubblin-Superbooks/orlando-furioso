She moves, where'er she turns her lucid eyes,
Not only is in charms without a peer,
But seems a goddess lighted from the skies:
With her is paired her brother's wife, who ne'er
Swerved from her plighted faith — aye good and wise —
Because ill Fortune bore her long despite;
Lo!  Arragonian Anna, Vasto's light!</p><blockquote><p>IX</p></blockquote><p>Anne gentle, courteous, and as sage as fair,
Temple of Love and Truth and Chastity:
With her, her sister dims all beauty, where
Her radiance shines.  Lo!  one that hath set free
Her conquering lord from Orcus' dark repair,
And him in spite of death and destiny
(Beyond all modern instance raised on high, )</p><p>To shine with endless glory in the sky.</p><blockquote><p>X</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">My ladies of Ferrara, those of gay
