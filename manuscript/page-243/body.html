Dispose (Rogero said to you intent. )</p><p>Silver and land to conquer, plate or mail
I swear not, I, in warlike cuirass pent;

Bestowed on such a valiant champion, paid:
They talking thus the bridge and river see,
And at her post the haughty dame arraid
(Sapphire and emerald decked the panoply)
In arms of gold: but I awhile delay
Till other strain the issue of the fray.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
