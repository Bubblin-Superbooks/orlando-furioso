The warrior is for ever on the wing.
Who lodges, housed in tavern every night,
As best as can, through his capacious ring.
So nights and days he passes: such delight
Prospects to him of land and ocean bring.
Arrived one morn nigh London-town, he stopt;
And over Thames the flying courser dropt.</p><blockquote><p>LXXIV</p></blockquote><p>Where he in meadows to the city nigh
Saw troops of men at arms, and footmen spread;
Who, to the drum and trumpet marching by,
Divided into goodly bands, were led
Before Rinaldo, flower of chivalry;
He that (if you remember it was said )</p><p>To have been sent by Charlemagne, and made
His envoy to these parts in search of aid.</p><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Rogero came exactly as the show
Of that fair host</p></div> </div>
