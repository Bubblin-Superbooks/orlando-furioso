If nought beside I hear, nor vest nor steed.
And this my comrade, I as surely know,
These for mere words as little will forego.</pre><h5>LXII</h5><pre>"But let me face to face, by Heaven, espy
Those who would take my horse and arms away;
For we have yet beyond that hill to hie,
And little time can here afford to stay."
"Behold the man," that ancient made reply,
"Clear of the bridge!" â€” Nor did in this missay;
For thence a warrior pricked, who, powdered o'er
With snowy flowers, a crimson surcoat wore.</pre><h5>LXIII</h5><pre class="  ">Bradamant for long time with earnest prayer,
For courtesy the good Rogero prest,
To let her from his sell the warrior bear,
Who with white flowers had purfled o'er his vest.
