Assorting with his moody rage, 'gan say:
" — Whoe'er thou art, sir knight, and whencesoe'er —
Brought by mistake of purpose or of way,
Light from thine horse and doff thy warlike gear,
To deck this sepulchre, ere thee I slay,
An offering to its lovely tenant's spirit;
And thou in thy forced homage have no merit."</p><blockquote><p>LXVII</p></blockquote><p>Brandimart, at the paynim's proud discourse,
His weapon in the rest, for answer, layed;
He good Batoldo spurred, his gentle horse,
And at the champion with such fury made,
As showed that he, for courage and for force,
With any warrior in the world had weighed.
King Rodomont as well, with rested spear,
Thundered along the bridge, in fierce career.</p><blockquote><p>LXVIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
