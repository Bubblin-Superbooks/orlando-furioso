Cannot, as I desire, on thee bestow,
I hope thy soul shall have; hope to be nigh,
To see thee suffer, in the realms of woe.'

With joyous face all over in a glow,
(She cried</code>Olindro, take this victim's life, )</p><p>With the good will of thine avenging wife;</p><blockquote><p>LXXIV</p></blockquote><p>" `And of our lord for me the grace obtain,
To be this day in paradise with thee,
If he reply, none cometh to your reign,
Without desert; say such I bring with me,
Who this fell impious monster, in his fane,
Offer, as my first-fruits; and what can be
A greater merit than to have supprest
Such loathsome and abominable pest?'</p><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
