"Unconquered Caesar, glorious and august,
Who, to Alcides' strait from Indian main,
Mak'st Scythian's pale and Aethiop's race adust
Revere thy Christian cross of snowy grain,
— Of earthly monarchs thou most sage and just —
Hither thy glory, which no limits bound,
Has brought me from the world's extremest ground;</pre><h5>XIII</h5><pre class="  ">"And (to avow the truth in jealous mood ) 

Alone I came, alone with thee to fight;
Because I grudged that king so puissant shou'd
Exist on earth, save he observed my rite.
