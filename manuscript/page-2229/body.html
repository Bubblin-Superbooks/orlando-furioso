Meseems that thou in tempting her didst fail
More than herself, that was so quickly caught.
I know not, had she tempted thee as much,
If thou, thyself, hadst better stood the touch."</pre><h5>L</h5><pre>Here ends Rinaldo, and — the parley done —
Rises and to his rest desires to go:
Awhile will he repose; and then be gone,
An hour or two before the daylight show.
But little time has Aymon's warlike son;
Nor idly will that little time bestow.
To him the mansion's master made reply,
He in his house might at his pleasure lie.</pre><h5>LI</h5><pre class="  ">For bed and bower, within, were ready dight;
But — would he take his counsel for his guide —
In comfort might he sleep throughout the night.
