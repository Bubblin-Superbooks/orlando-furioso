Go forth afflicted, and return in mirth:
Backed by few foot, and fewer cavaliers,
He homeward barks, and fifteen gallies steers.</pre><h5>LVIII</h5><pre>"Two Sigismonds, the first, the second, see;
To these Alphonso's five good sons succeed;
Whose glories spread o'er seas and land shall be.
The first shall wed a maid of France's seed.
This is the second Hercules; and he,

Hippolitus; who with the light shall shine,
Of his wise uncle, gilding all his line.</pre><h5>LIX</h5><pre class="  ">"Francis the third comes next; the other two

Fair virgin, would too long protract thy stay;
