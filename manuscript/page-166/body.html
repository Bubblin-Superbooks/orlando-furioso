Albany's duke find favour in my sight.</p><blockquote><p>VIII</p></blockquote><p>"And for he seemed to cherish me above
All mean; his love a love as ardent bred.
We hear, indeed, and see, but do not prove
Man's faith, nor is his bosom's purpose read.
Believing still, and yielding to my love,
I ceased not till I took him to my bed;
Nor, of all chambers, in that evil hour,
Marked I was in Geneura's priviest bower.</p><blockquote><p>IX</p></blockquote><p>"Where, hoarded, she with careful privacy
Preserved whatever she esteemed most rare;
There many times she slept.  A gallery
From thence projected into the open air.
Here oft I made my lover climb to me,
And (what he was to mount a hempen stair, )</p><p>When him I to my longing arms would call,
From the projecting balcony let fall.</p><blockquote><p>X</p></blockquote></div> </div>
