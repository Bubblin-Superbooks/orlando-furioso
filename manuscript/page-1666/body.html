By which she oft to meet Rogero went,
Hears tidings, that of Hope — last comfort left —
(Like every other good her breast bereft. )</pre><h5>XXVIII</h5><pre>Bound homeward from the hostile camp, where lay
King Agramant, she met a Gascon knight,
A prisoner to those paynims, from the day,
That fought nigh Paris was the famous fight.
The damsel prest him all he knew to say:
Then to the point she covets led the knight:
Asks of Rogero, on that theme abides,

As well acquainted with the court; he said
How, matched with Mandricardo, strove that lord,
And layed the martial king in combat dead.
