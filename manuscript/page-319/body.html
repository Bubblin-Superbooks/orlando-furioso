Dost thou, perchance, yet rove thy lonely round?
Art thou, indeed, to ravening wolf a prize,
Without thy faithful Roland's succour found?
And is the flower, which, with the deities,
Me, in mid heaven had placed, which, not to wound,
(So reverent was my love thy feelings chaste, )</p><p>I kept untouched, alas!  now plucked and waste?</p><blockquote><p>LXXVIII</p></blockquote><p>"If this fair flower be plucked, oh, misery!  oh,
Despair!  what more is left me but to die?
Almighty God, with every other woe
Rather than this, thy wretched suppliant try.
If this be true, these hands the fatal blow
Shall deal, and doom me to eternity."
Mixing his plaint with bitter tears and sighs,
So to himself the grieved Orlando cries.</p><blockquote><p>LXXIX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
