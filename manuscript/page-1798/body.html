Catching their colour from that kindly sky.
So green the grass!  could we have such below,

To the quick air such lively motion lends,
That Day's oppressive noon in nought offends;</pre><h5>LI</h5><pre class="  ">And this, mid fruit and flower and verdure there,
Evermore stealing divers odours, went;
