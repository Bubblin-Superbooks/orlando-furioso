She rather ne'er was banished from his breast;
And fanned the secret fire, which through the day
(Now kindled into flame had seemed at rest; ) 

That in his escort even from Catay
Or farthest Ind, had journeyed to the west;
There lost: Of whom he had discerned no token
Since Charles's power near Bordeaux-town was broken.</pre><h5>LXXIII</h5><pre>This in Orlando moved great grief, and he
Lay thinking on his folly past in vain:

(When night and day I might have dwelt with thee,
Since this thou didst not in thy grace disdain.)
To have let them place thee in old Namus' hand!
Witless a wrong so crying to withstand.</pre></div> </div>
