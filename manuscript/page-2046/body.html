Recites at length Lucretia Borgia's fame,
Whom Rome should place, for charms and chastity,
Above that wife who whilom bore her name.
Strozza and Tebaldeo — Anthony
And Hercules — support the honoured dame:
(So says the scroll): for tuneful strain, the pair
A very Linus and an Orpheus are.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIV</p></blockquote><p>A statue no less jocund, no less bright,
Succeeds, and on the writing is impressed;
Lo!  Hercules' daughter, Isabella hight,
In whom Ferrara deems her city blest,
Much more because she first shall see the light
Within its circuit, than for all the rest
Which kind and favouring Fortune in the flow
Of rolling years, shall on that town bestow.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The pair that such desirous ardour shew
That aye her praises should be widely blown:
John James alike are</p></div> </div>
