Of Luna he: the heavens, on all sides clear,

Breathed upon them an air, in her first port,

But moulders iron, and here life is short;

Wrongs Famagosta, poisoning, in such sort,
That city with Constantia's fen malign,
To all the rest of Cyprus so benign.</p><blockquote><p>CXXXVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The noxious scents that from the marish spring,
After short sojourn there, compel their flight.
