Who hardly had escaped his hand, sore prest
And scared as never yet was living wight;
So that he trembled still, disturbed in mind,
And deemed the knight of the unicorn behind.</pre><h5>CIV</h5><pre>He by the buckler knew as soon as spied
The cavalier, whose arms that blazon bear,

For audience, weighty tidings to declare;
And, to Ungiardo led forthwith, rehearsed
What shall by men in other strain be versed.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
