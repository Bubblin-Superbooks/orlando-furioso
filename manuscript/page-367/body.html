Not hoping that he would have thriven so well;
— Enough for her, if by her misery bought,
Her spouse were rescued from the tyrant's cell! —
Her, full of love and loyal homage, sought
The people one and all:  Twere long to tell
How she caressed Bireno, he the maid, —
What thanks both lovers to the county paid.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVI</p></blockquote><p>The people, throned in her paternal reign,
Replace the injured dame, and fealty swear:
She on the duke, to whom in solid chain
Love with eternal knot had linked the fair,
The empire of herself and her domain
Conferred: He, called away by other care,
Left in the cousin's guardian care this while
His fortresses, and all the subject isle.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
