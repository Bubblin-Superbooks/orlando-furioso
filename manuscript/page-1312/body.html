Emptied her horn, him honoured as his lord.
Here they conclude they can the brethren free
Without more succour from their gaoler's ward.
This while Sleep seized on lord and family,
Save young Rogero: no repose afford

And, rankling in his bosom, banish rest.</pre><h5>LXXXI</h5><pre>The siege of Agramant, to him that day
Told by the messenger, he has at heart.

If he against his sovereign lord take part?
Oh!  what foul cowardice, how foul a crime
His baptism will appear at such a time!</pre></div> </div>
