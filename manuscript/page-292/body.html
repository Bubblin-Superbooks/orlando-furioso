That same enchantress, still benign and wise,
Who, knowing she a matchless race should bear
Of men, or rather semi-deities,
Spies daily what her thoughts and actions are,
And lots for her each day, divining, tries; â€”
She all Rogero's fortune knew, how freed;
Then borne to India by the griffin steed:</code></pre><blockquote><p>XL</p></blockquote><pre><code>Him on that courser plainly she had eyed,
Who would not the controlling rein obey;
When, severed by such interval, he hied,
Borne through the perilous, unwonted way:
And knew that he sport, dance, and banquet plied,
And lapt in idleness and pleasure lay;
Nor memory of his lord nor of the dame,
Once loved so well, preserved, not of his fame.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XLI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
