As soon as his ill will was satisfied
On this my wretched person, which alone
He so by brutal force should make his own.</pre><h5>XXX</h5><pre>"With these, and words like these, I moved the peer,
When I such puissance in myself espied;
And him so contrite made, in desert drear,
Was never seen a saint more mortified.
Before my feet the doleful cavalier
Fell down, and snatched a poniard from his side;
Which, he protested, I parforce should take,
And for so foul a sin my vengeance slake.</pre><h5>XXXI</h5><pre class="  ">"To push my mighty victory to an end
I scheme, when him I see in such distress,
And give him hopes he may even yet pretend
That I deservedly his love should bless,
