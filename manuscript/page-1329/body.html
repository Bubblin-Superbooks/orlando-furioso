Slays ten or twenty, shifting his career;

Are from the saddle seen to disappear:
Before it vanish cuirass, helms and shields,
As the dry wood to fire in forest yields.</pre><h5>XVII</h5><pre class="  ">If ever you remember to have viewed,

And all the winged college is at feud,
Mustering their swarms for mischief in mid air, —
The greedy swallow swoop amid that brood,
To mangle and devour, and kill, and tear,
