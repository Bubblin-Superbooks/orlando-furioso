Their strokes they at the head or foot address;
And these so skilfully and nimbly deal,
As needs must shock all credence to express.

Who doth his miserable soul possess,
Evermore with such caution strikes his blow,
That he is deemed less vigorous than his foe.</pre><h5>XC</h5><pre>Rather to parry then to smite intent,

Nor willingly the Child by him would die.
But here I am at my full line's extent,
Where I must needs defer my history.</pre><blockquote><p>Canto shall the rest appear,
