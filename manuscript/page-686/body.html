<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Barred by the giant's solitary den
Cut off from converse with humanity.
About it heads and naked limbs of men
Were fixed, the victims of his cruelty.
Window or battlements was not, whence strung
Might not be seen some wretched prisoner hung.</pre><h5>L</h5><pre>As in hill-farm or castle, fenced with moat,
The hunter, mindful what his dangers were,
Aye fastens on his door the shaggy coat
And horrid paws and monstrous head of bear;
So showed the giant those of greatest note,
Who, thither brought, had perished in his snare.
The bones of countless others wide were spread,
And every ditch with human blood was red.</pre><h5>LI</h5><pre class="  ">Caligorant was standing at the gate
(For so was the  despiteous monster hight);
