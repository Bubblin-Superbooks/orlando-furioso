<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Moorish files betray their fear;
And, trembling in their hands, is seen the lance,
Their thighs and stirrups quivering, like the spear.
King Pulian only marks the knight's advance,
Knowing Rinaldo not, unchanged in cheer;
Nor thinking such a cruel shock to meet,
Gallops against him on his courser fleet.</p><blockquote><p>XLV</p></blockquote><p>He stoops upon the weapon which he strains,
Whole and collected for the martial game:
Then to his horse abandoning the reins,
And goading with both spurs the courser, came.
Upon the other side no valour feigns,
But shows, by doings, what he is in name;
â€” With what rare grace and matchless art he wars,
The son of Aymon, rather son of Mars.</p><blockquote><p>XLVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Well-matched in skill, they aimed their cruel blows,
With lances at each other's heads addrest;
Ill matched,</p></div> </div>
