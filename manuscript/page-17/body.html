Of Germany and France, King Charlemagne
Had camped his faithful host upon the plain.</p><blockquote><p>VI</p></blockquote><p>To make King Agramant, for penance, smite
His cheek, and rash Marsilius rue the hour;
This, when all trained with lance and sword to fight,
He led from Africa to swell his power;
That other when he pushed, in fell despite,
Against the realm of France Spain's martial flower.
'Twas thus Orlando came where Charles was tented
In evil hour, and soon the deed repented.</p><blockquote><p>VII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">For here was seized his dame of peerless charms,
(How often human judgment wanders wide)!
Whom in long warfare he had kept from harms,
From western climes to eastern shores her guide
In his own land, 'mid friends and kindred arms,
Now without contest severed</p></div> </div>
