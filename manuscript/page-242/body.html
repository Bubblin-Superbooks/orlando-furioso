Whom he left stabled in the cool retreat,
Started at something in the wood descried,
Scared by I know not what; and in his heat

Where scanty pith ill fills the narrow sheath,
The vapour, in its little channel pent,
Struggles, tormented by the fire beneath;
And, till its prisoned fury find a vent,
Is heard to hiss and bubble, sing and seethe:
So the offended myrtle inly pined,
Groaned, murmured, and at last unclosed its rind:</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXVIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
