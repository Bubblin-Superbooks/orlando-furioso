Have done this scathe and outrage undesigned.
But not the less for that, to me reply,
What art thou, who, in rugged case confined,
Dost live and speak?  And so may never hail
From angry heaven your gentle boughs assail!</pre><h5>XXXI</h5><pre>"And if I now or ever the despite

Who in her keeping has my better part,
To strive with word and deed, till thou requite
The service done with praise and grateful heart."
