One bore a corded ladder, one a book;
One a dull file, or bar of iron shook.</p><blockquote><p>LXIII</p></blockquote><p>The captain of this crew, which blocked the road,
Appeared, with monstrous paunch and bloated face;
Who a slow tortoise for a horse bestrode,
That passing sluggishly with him did pace:
Down looked, some here, some there, sustained the load,
For he was drunk, and kept him in his place.
Some wipe his brows and chin from sweat which ran,
And others with their vests his visage fan.</p><blockquote><p>LXIV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">One, with a human shape and feet, his crest,
Fashioned like hound, in neck and ears and head,
Bayed at the gallant Child with angry quest,
To turn him to the city whence he fled.
"That will I never, while of strength possessed
To brandish this," the good Rogero</p></div> </div>
