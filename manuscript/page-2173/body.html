Him Dudon, Guido, would accompany;
But he refuses either valiant friend:
From Paris he departs, and wends alone,
Plunged in his grief and heaving many a groan.</pre><h5>XLIV</h5><pre>Ever in memory dwells the restless thought,
He might a thousand times have had the fair;
And — mad and obstinate — had, when besought,
A thousand times refused such beauty rare;
And such sweet joy was whilom set at nought,
Such bright, such blessed moments wasted were;
And now he life would gladly give away
To have that damsel but for one short day.</pre><h5>XLV</h5><pre class="  ">The thought will never from his mind depart,
How for a sorry footpage she could slight,
— Flinging their merit and their love apart —
