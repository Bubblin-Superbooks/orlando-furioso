<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">who spent more time and pain
Seeking the friendly court of Charlemagne.</p><blockquote><p>LXIX</p></blockquote><p>Rogero thence departs; but as before
Takes not the way he took in his despite,
When him above the sea the courser bore,
And seldom was the land beneath in sight.
But taught to make him beat his wings and soar,
Here, there, as liked him best, with docile flight,
Returning, he another path pursued;
As Magi erst, who Herod's snare eschewed.</p><blockquote><p>LXX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Borne hither, good Rogero, leaving Spain,
Had sought, in level line, the Indian lands,
Where they are watered by the Eastern main;
Where the two fairies strove with hostile bands.
He now resolved to visit other reign
Than that where Aeolus his train commands;
And finish so the round he had begun,
Circling the world</p></div> </div>
