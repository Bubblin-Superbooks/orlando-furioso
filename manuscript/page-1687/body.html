With towns and cities of their own supplied;
Which mansions of such mighty size contain,
Such never he before of after spied.
Here spacious hold and lonely forest lay,
Where nymphs for ever chased the panting prey.</p><blockquote><p>LXXIII</p></blockquote><p>He, that with other scope had thither soared,
Pauses not all these wonder to peruse:
But led by the disciple of our Lord,
His way towards a spacious vale pursues;
A place wherein is wonderfully stored
Whatever on our earth below we lose.
Collected there are all things whatsoe'er,
Lost through time, chance, or our own folly, here.</p><blockquote><p>LXXIV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Nor here alone of realm and wealthy dower,
O'er which aye turns the restless wheel, I say:

Of Fortune to bestow, or take</p></div> </div>
