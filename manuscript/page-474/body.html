His level sight along the water thrown,
Naked as born, bound to a stump, espied
A dame whose feet were wetted by the tide.</pre><h5>XXXIV</h5><pre>Because she distant is, and evermore
Holds down her face, he ill can her discern:
Both sculls he pulls amain, and nears the shore,
With keen desire more certain news to learn:
But now the winding beach is heard to roar,
And wood and cave the mighty noise return;
The billows swell, and, lo!  the beast!  who pressed,
And nigh concealed the sea beneath his breast.</pre><h5>XXXV</h5><pre class="  ">As cloud from humid vale is seen to rise,
Pregnant with rain and storm, which seems withal
To extinguished day, and charged with deeper dyes
Than night, to spread throughout this earthly ball,
