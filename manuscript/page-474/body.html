Where Philomel for ever seemed to plain;
I' the middle was a meadow with a fountain,
And, at each end, a solitary mountain.</code></pre><blockquote><p>CXIV</p></blockquote><pre><code>'Twas here the wishful knight first checked the rein,
And dropping in the meadow, made his steed
Furl, yet not shut so close, his wings again,
As he had spread them wide for better speed.
Down lights Rogero, and forbears with pain
From other leap; but this his arms impede:
His arms impede; a bar to his desire,
And he must doff them would he slake the fire.</code></pre><blockquote><p>CXV</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>Now here, now there, confused by different throng,
Rogero did his shining arms undo:
Never the task appeared to him so</pre></div> </div>
