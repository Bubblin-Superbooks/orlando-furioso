<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Aspramont,
By Agolant's bold son: but shouldst thou meet
The warrior whom thou seekest, front to front,
I warrant thou wouldst quake from head to feet;
Nor only wouldst forego the casque, but give
The knight thine other arms to let thee live."</code></pre><blockquote><p>XLIV</p></blockquote><pre><code>— "So oft have I had Roland on the hip,
And oft," (exclaimed the boaster "heretofore; ) 

From him it had been easy task to strip
What other arms, beside his helm, he wore;
And if I still have let the occasion slip,
— We sometimes think of things unwished before:
Such wish I had not; I have now; and hope
To compass easily my present scope."</code></pre><blockquote><p>XLV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
