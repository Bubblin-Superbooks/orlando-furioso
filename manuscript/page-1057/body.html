This your excuse; which now too late is made.
'Tis yours the law's observance to compel,
And not with lying tongue your oath evade."
" â€” Behold!  the arms; behold, with a new sell
And cloth, the goodly steed!"  Rogero said,
"Behold with these, as well, the damsel's vest!
If these you covet, why your course arrest?"</p><blockquote><p>LXXX</p></blockquote><p>She of the castle presses on this side,
On that Rogero rates, and calls them on;
Till they parforce, t'wards him, together hied:
But red with shame, are to the encounter gone.
Foremost appeared 'mid those three knights of pride,
Of Burgundy's good marquis either son.
But Guido, who was borne on heavier steed,
Came at some interval, with tardier speed.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
