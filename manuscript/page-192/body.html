(For leagued in friendship were the cavaliers,
Till, rivals, they pursued this common quest)
"I marvel, since you are of all my peers
He, whom I must have honoured and caressed,
And held in high regard, and cherished still,
You should my benefits repay so ill.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXVIII</p></blockquote><pre><code>" `I am assured you comprehend and know
Mine and Geneura's love, and old accord;
And, in legitimate espousal, how

Then why disturb my suit, and why bestow
Your heart on her who offers no reward?
By Heaven, I should respect your claim and place,
Were your condition mine, and mine your case.'</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXIX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
