Together with himself, beneath one roof,
At few leagues' distance, did Montpelier stand,
And other wealthy towns, not far aloof.

So that its every need might be supplied.</p><blockquote><p>XCV</p></blockquote><p>Here standing, full of thought, upon a day,

Was by a bearded monk accompanied;
And these behind them led a lusty steed,
