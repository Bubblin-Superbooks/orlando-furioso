And vows till she is to her state restored,
And just and memorable vengeance there
Achieved upon her perjured, traitor lord,
He never will unceasing war forbear,
Waged with all means that Ireland can afford;
And this with all his speed.  He, up and down,
Meantime bids seek for female vest and gown.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXIV</p></blockquote><pre><code>Now will it need to send in search of vest
Beyond the savage island's narrow bound,
Since thither every day in such came dressed,
Some dame, to feed the beast, from countries round.
Nor long his followers there pursued the quest,
Ere many they of various fashions found.
So was Olympia clothed; while sad of mood
Was he, not so to clothe her as he wou'd.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
