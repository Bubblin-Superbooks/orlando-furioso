Of our connection and of amity;
And quickly of my land thy troops possest,
To assure the rule unto thyself.  Shall I
Return to Flanders where I sold the rest,
Though little, upon which I lived, to buy
Thee needful succour and from prison bear?
Wretch, whither shall I go? — I know not where.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXII</p></blockquote><pre><code>"Can I to Friesland go, where I to reign
As queen was called, and this for thee forewent;
Where both my brethren and my sire were slain,
And every other good from me was rent? —
Thee would I not, thou ingrate, with my pain
Reproach, not therefore deal thee punishment:
As well as I, the story dost thou know;
Now, see the meed thou dost for this bestow!</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
