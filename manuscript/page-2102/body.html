If with less vigour and less prowess steeled,
At least in courtesy he would not yield.</pre><h5>VI</h5><pre>"Pardi, sir, make we peace;" (he said "success )

Cannot be mine; for I myself confess
Conquered and captive to thy courtesy."

But this upon condition, that those seven
Are freed from bondage, and to me are given."</pre><h5>VII</h5><pre class="  ">With that he showed those seven whereof I spake,
Bound and with drooping heads, a sad array;
Adding, he must to him no hindrance make,
Who would those kings to Africa convey.
