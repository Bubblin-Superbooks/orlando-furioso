<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre>Rodomont o'er the plain pursues his man.
â€” Another stroke, and he has lost the horse!
But Richardetto drives, and Vivian,
Between the Child and paynim in that course.
This warrior at the king of Argier ran,
And from Rogero severed him by force;
That (it was Vivian in Rogero's hand, ) 

Now from the blow recovered, placed his brand.</pre><h5>CXX</h5><pre>As soon as to himself the Child returns,
And is by Vivian armed with sword again,
To venge the injury that stripling burns,
And runs at Rodomont with flowing rein,
Like lion, whom a bull upon his horns
Has lifted, though he feels this while no pain,
So him his heat of blood, disdain, and ire,
To venge that cruel outrage goad and fire.</pre></div> </div>
