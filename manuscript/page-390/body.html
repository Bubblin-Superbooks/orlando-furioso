His troubled visage, all with sweat besprent,
Began to pray, `on what he had in hand

Would rest his weary limbs, beside them laid.'</p><blockquote><p>XXXIX</p></blockquote><p>To hold the stirrup one approaching near,

With foaming wine, which raised his thirst the more;

For anything, each lett would time supply
To Alcina to arrive, who now was nigh.</p><blockquote><p>XL</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Now so saltpetre fine and sulphur pure,
Touched with the fiery spark, blaze suddenly;
Not so loud ocean raves, when the obscure
Whirlwind descends and camps</p></div> </div>
