<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">cheats Brunello is as well
Instructed, as the sage in charm and spell.</p><blockquote><p>LXX</p></blockquote><p>"Brunello, he so practised and so sly
As now I tell thee, by his king is sent,
That he with aid of mother wit may try,
And of this ring, well proved in like event,
To take Rogero from the castle high;
So has he boasted, by the wizard pent:
And to his lord such promise did impart,
Who has Rogero's presence most at heart.</p><blockquote><p>LXXI</p></blockquote><p>"That his escape to thee alone may owe,
Not to the king, the youthful cavalier,
How to release Rogero from his foe
And his enchanted cage, prepare to hear.
Three days along the shingle shalt thou go,
Beside the sea, whose waves will soon appear;
Thee the third day shall to a hostel bring,
Where he shall come who bears the virtuous ring.</p><blockquote><p>LXXII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
