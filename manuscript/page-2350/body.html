He from his lofty station eyes the knight,
Who with his single arm destroys that host;
And cannot choose, though so his prowess harms,
But praise that peer and own his worth in arms.</pre><h5>XC</h5><pre>He knew full well by ensignry displaid,
By surcoat and by gilded panoply,
That albeit to the foe he furnished aid,

Wondering his superhuman deeds surveyed;
And now an angel seemed in him to see,
To scourge the Greeks from quires above descended,
Whose sins so oft and oft had heaven offended;</pre><h5>XCI</h5><pre class="  ">And, as a man of great and noble heart,
(Where many others would have hatred sworn)
Enamoured of such valour, on his part,
