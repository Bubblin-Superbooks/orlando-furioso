<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre><code>For so with reason I this place may call,
Where, it is my belief, that Love had birth;
Where life is spent in festive game and ball,
And still the passing moments fleet in mirth.
Here hoary-headed Thought ne'er comes at all,
Nor finds a place in any bosom.  Dearth,
Nor yet Discomfort, never enter here,
Where Plenty fills her horn throughout the year.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXIV</p></blockquote><pre><code>Here, where with jovial and unclouded brow,
Glad April seems to wear a constant smile,
Troop boys and damsels: One, whose fountains flow,
On the green margin sings in dulcet style;
Others, the hill or tufted tree below,
In dance, or no mean sport the hours beguile.
While this, who shuns the revellers' noisy cheer,
Tells his love sorrows in his comrade's ear.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
