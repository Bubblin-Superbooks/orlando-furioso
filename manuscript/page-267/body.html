<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Like ivory smooth, the forehead gay and round
Fills up the space, and forms a fitting bound.</pre><h5>XII</h5><pre>Two black and slender arches rise above
Two clear black eyes, say suns of radiant light,
Which ever softly beam and slowly move;
Round these appears to sport in frolic flight,
Hence scattering all his shafts, the little Love,
And seems to plunder hearts in open sight.
Thence, through mid visage, does the nose descend,
Where Envy finds not blemish to amend.</pre><h5>XIII</h5><pre class="  ">As if between two vales, which softly curl,
The mouth with vermeil tint is seen to glow:
Within are strung two rows of orient pearl,
Which her delicious lips shut up or show.
Of force to melt the heart of any churl,
However rude, hence courteous accents flow:
