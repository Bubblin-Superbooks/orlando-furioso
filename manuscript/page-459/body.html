In ancient days before the Phrygian swain,
By how much heavenly Venus had prevailed

To be the ornament of Juno's shrine,
And hence so many naked dames collected;
And in one form perfection to combine,
Some separate charm from this or that selected,
He from no other model need have wrought.
Since joined in her were all the charms he sought.</p><blockquote><p>LXXII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
