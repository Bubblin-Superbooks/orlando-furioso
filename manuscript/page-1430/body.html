With thee for this would battle, tooth and nail."</pre><h5>LXXVIII</h5><pre>They from dispute proceed to ribaldry,
From words to blows; and through their mickle ire,
Fierce battle was inflamed, and blazed more high
Than ever lightly-kindled straw took fire.
King Rodomont is steeled in panoply;
Sacripant neither plate nor mail attire:
Yet so in fence is skilled that nimble lord,
He seems all over sheltered by his sword.</pre><h5>LXXIX</h5><pre class="  ">No greater were the daring and the might
(Though infinite which Rodomont displaid ) 

Than the precaution and the nimble sleight
Which the Circassian summoned to his aid:
No mill-wheel ever turns with swifter flight
