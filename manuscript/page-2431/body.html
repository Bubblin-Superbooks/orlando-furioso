And seeking whom, he now in person came.

Such pious work, he spurred behind the dame;

For three long days, so broken down; with pain

Where the white unicorn was seen pourtraid.</pre><h5>XXVII</h5><pre class="  ">There thinking what an injury he had done
To his lady love â€” how ingrate, how untrue
