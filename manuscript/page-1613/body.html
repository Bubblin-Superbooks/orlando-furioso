Lo!  with the youthful Sforza makes accord:
Lo!  Bourbon the fair city keeps, in right
Of Francis, from the furious German horde:
Lo!  while in other high emprize and fight
Elsewhere is occupied his royal lord,
Nor knows the pride and license of his host,
Through these the city shall anew be lost.</p><blockquote><p>XLV</p></blockquote><p>"Lo!  other French who his grandsire's vein
Inherits, not his generous name alone!
Who by the Church's favour will regain
— The Gaul expelled — a land which was his own.
France too returns, but keeps a tighter rein,
Nor over Italy, as wont, has flown:
For Mantua's noble duke the foe shall stay,
And, at Ticino's passage, bar his way.</p><blockquote><p>XLVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Though on his cheek youth's blossoms scarce</p></div> </div>
