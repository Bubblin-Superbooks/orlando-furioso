Fear, doubt, and his own native, rancorous mood,
That unawares he issued from the track,
And found himself within a gloomy wood:
Where a rough mountain reared its shaggy back,
Whose stony peak above the forest stood;
The daughter of Dodona's duke behind,
Dogging his footsteps through the thicket blind.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXIX</p></blockquote><pre><code>He, when he saw himself within the brake,
Thought to abandon his unweeting foe;
And to the dame â€” " 'Twere better that we make
For shelter ere the gathering darkness grow;
And, yonder mountain past, (save I mistake)
A tower is seated in the vale below.
Do you expect me then, while from the peak
I measure the remembered place I seek."</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
