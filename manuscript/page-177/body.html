Deemed by Geneura's fault his brother dead,
Weening the faithless duke, whom she refused,
Was taken by the damsel to her bed;
And her before the king and peers accused:
But to the session Ariodantes led,
Strives with his brother in disguise.  In season
Rinaldo comes to venge the secret treason.</code></pre><blockquote><p>I</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>Among all other animals who prey
On earth, or who unite in friendly wise,
Whether they mix in peace or moody fray,
No male offends his mate.  In safety hies
The she bear, matched with hers, through forest</pre></div> </div>
