Since Agramant the crown and staff of gold,
Once Pinador's, had given to him to hold.</pre><h5>XXII</h5><pre>Hesperia's people come with Soridan,
With Dorilon the men of Setta ride;
The Nasamonians troop with Pulian,
And Agricaltes is Ammonia's guide.

And Finaduro leads the band supplied
By the Canary Islands and Morocco:

The first beneath their ancient captains wend;
The second troop without a leader, who
