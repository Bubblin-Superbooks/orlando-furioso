When her Marphisa to his care conveyed.</pre><h5>VI</h5><pre>Because as foe to her and hers she knew
The knight they were encountering, who had slain
Her only brother and her father true;
And was advised, the traitor would be fain

I will not thou shouldst any danger dread."</pre><h5>VII</h5><pre class="  ">As nearer now, the stranger knight espied
That face, which was so hateful in his sight,
With menacing and savage voice he cried,
"Either with me prepare thyself to fight,
Or arm thee not on that old woman's side,
Who by my hand shall perish, as is right.
