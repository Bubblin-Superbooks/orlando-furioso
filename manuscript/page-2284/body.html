<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Repeating the beloved name in vain,
With all her force her scorn and fury wreaks;
Uproots and tears, her locks, and in her pain
Like woman, smit by evil demon, shrieks,
Or, as Bacchante at the horn's rude sound,
Erewhile was seen to run her restless round.</pre><h5>CLIX</h5><pre>Now to the one, to the other now her prayer
She made for knife, wherewith her heart to smite;
Now she aboard the pinnace would repair
That brought the corse of either paynim knight,
And would on either, lifeless as they were,
Do cruel scathe, and vent her fierce despite.
Now would she seek her lord, till at his side
She rested from her weary search, and died.</pre><h5>CLX</h5><pre class="  ">"Ah!  wherefore, Brandimart, did I let thee
Without me wend on such a dire emprize?
