To be baptized and do as I professed.
If I have lingered, I have been delaid,
By other wound than that of Love opprest."

And with the vision broken was her rest.

And to herself in this sad fashion said:</pre><h5>LXII</h5><pre>"What pleased was but a dream; alas!  a sheer
Reality is this my waking bane;
My joy a dream and prompt to disappear,
No dream my cruel and tormenting pain.
Ah!  wherefore what I seemed to see and hear,
Cannot I, waking, see and hear again?
What ails ye, wretched eyes, that closed ye show
Unreal good, and open but on woe?</pre><h5>LXIII</h5></div> </div>
