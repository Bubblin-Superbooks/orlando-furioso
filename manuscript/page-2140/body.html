By that rare force, which now extinct remained.
Bucklers by other followers carried are,
Won from good warriors, whose device they bear.</p><blockquote><p>CLXXIX</p></blockquote><p>By hundreds and by hundreds followed more,
Ordained for different tasks, the steps of those;
Who burning torches like those others bore.
Mantled, say rather closely muffled, goes
Roland in sables next, and evermore
His eyes suffused and red with weeping shows.
Nor wears a gladder face Montalban's peer.
At home his wound detains Sir Olivier.</p><blockquote><p>CLXXX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The ceremonies would be long to say
In verse, wherewith Sir Brandimart was mourned;
The mantles, black or purple, given away;
The many torches which that eve were burned.
Wending to the cathedral, where the array
Past on its road, were no dry eyes</p></div> </div>
