He shrewdly waits his time till there should be
Discord between the beldam and his wife:
For whereso women are, is stir and strife.</pre><h5>CXXI</h5><pre>"And even that Anselmo waited, so
Befell; since, angered by the first despite,
Unsought of him, to him that nurse did go,
To tell the whole; and nothing hid from sight.
How sank his heart beneath that cruel blow,
'Twere long to say; how prostrate lay his sprite.
So was the wretched judge with grief opprest,
He of his wits well-nigh was dispossest;</pre><h5>CXXII</h5><pre class="  ">"And finally resolved to die, so burned
His rage, but first would kill the faithless dame;
And he with one destructive faulchion yearned
To free himself from woe and her from shame.
