For, harassed sore in body and in mind,
Those warriors all were weary, all were woe.
Each in repose and quietude designed
To pass what time remained to him below:
Each cursed the senseless anger and the hate
Which stirred their hearts to discord and debate.</pre><h5>LXVII</h5><pre class="  ">Rinaldo felt himself much magnified,

More trusted him than all his court beside,
