Were well deserving love upon thy part;
To whom (unless forgot, thou know'st how true
The tale thou debtor for thy freedom art, )</p><p>This ring, which can each magic spell undo,
Sends for thy succour, and would send her heart,
If with such virtue fraught, her heart could bring
Thee safely in thy perils, like the ring."</p><blockquote><p>LXIX</p></blockquote><p>How Bradamant had loved, and loves, she says,
Continuing to Rogero her relation;
To this, her worth commends with fitting praise,
Tempering in truth and fondness her narration;
And still employs the choicest mode and phrase,
Which fits one skilful in negociation,
And on the false Alcina brings such hate,
As on things horrible is wont to wait;</p><blockquote><p>LXX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
