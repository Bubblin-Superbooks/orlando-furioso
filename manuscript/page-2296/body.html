In other place; on Alpine mountain hoar
Here he affronts the bear of rugged kind;
And there in rushy bottom bays the boar:
Now on his jennet he outgoes the wind,
And drives some goat or gallant hind before;
Which falls o'ertaken on the dusty plain,
By his descending faulchion cleft in twain.</p><blockquote><p>XCII</p></blockquote><p>He is descried, amid a fair array
Of poets and philosophers elsewhere

These earth, these heaven for his instruction square.
Some chant sad elegies, some verses gay
Lays lyric or heroic; singers there
He with rich music hears; nor moves a pace
But what in every step is sovereign grace.</p><blockquote><p>XCIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The first part of the storied walls pourtraied
