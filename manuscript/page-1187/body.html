Returning with the staff's unbroken end.
The warriors, who with steed had ever smit,

Armed with two clubs, maintain a cruel fight.</pre><h5>LXXXIV</h5><pre>The truncheons which the valiant champions bear,
Fail in the combat, and few blows resist;
Both rage with mightier fury, here and there,
Left without other weapon than the fist;
With this the desperate foes engage, and, where
The hand can grapple, plate and mail untwist.
Let none desire, to guard himself from wrongs,
A heavier hammer or more holding tongs.</pre><h5>LXXXV</h5><pre class="  ">How can the Saracen conclude the fray
