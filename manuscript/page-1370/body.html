Upon no other ground, will I support
That battle shall not be between us two;
Nor will accord an hour of truce to you."</pre><h5>XCVIII</h5><pre>While of that African he so demands
Frontino, or him threats with instant fray;
And either still the other's claim withstands,
Nor this the steed will grant, nor that delay;
King Mandricardo stirs, on the other hand,
Another strife; who sees that ensign gay
Rogero on his shield was wont to wear,
The bird which reigns o'er other fowls of air.</pre><h5>XCIX</h5><pre class="  ">He bore on azure field that eagle white,
The beauteous ensign of the Trojan throng:
Such glorious bearing showed that youthful knight,
Because he drew his line from Hector strong.
