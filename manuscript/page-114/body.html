So each of these would gladly spend his breath,
And for his brother brave perpetual death.</p><blockquote><p>LI</p></blockquote><p>"In these two princes' excellent affection,
Their happy lieges more assurance feel,

Astrea shall appear returned from heaven,
To this low earth to varying seasons given.</p><blockquote><p>LII</p></blockquote><p>"Well is it that his wisdom shines as bright
As his good sire's, nor is his valour less;
Since here usurping Venice arms for fight,
And her full troops his scanty numbers press,
There she (I know not if more justly hight
Mother or stepmother brings new distress; )</p></div> </div>
