<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">eye,
Where you shall thirty thousand Scots, a crew
Led by their monarch's son, Zerbino, view.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIV</p></blockquote><p>"The lion 'twixt two unicorns behold
Upon the standard of the Scottish king!
Which has a sword of silver in its hold.
There camps his son: of all his following
Is none so beauteous: nature broke the mould
In which she cast him, after fashioning
Her work: Is none in whom such chivalry
And valour shines.  The Duke of Rothsay he!</p><blockquote><p>LXXXV</p></blockquote><p>"Behold the Earl of Huntley's flag display
Upon an azure field a gilded bar:
In that a leopard in the toils survey,
The bearing of the noble Duke of Mar.
With many birds, and many colours gay,
See Alcabrun's, a valiant man in war;
Who neither duke, nor count, nor marquis hight,
Is in his savage country first of right.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
