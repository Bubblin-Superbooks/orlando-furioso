At the great feat which I performed that day;
Greater than if the squadrons of the Moor
And Frank united I had held at bay;
And shall Rogero, new to martial lore,
Me, onto to one, with scathe or scorn appay?
And me shall now this young Rogero scare,
When Hector's sword and Hector's arms I wear?</pre><h5>XLII</h5><pre>"Ah!  as I might have won you from my foe,
Why did I not for you in arms contend?
I so had them my valour shown, I know,
You would have well foreseen Rogero's end.
For heaven's sake dry your tears, nor by such woe
— An evil omen for my arms — offend;
And learn, 'tis Honour pricks me to the field,
And not an argent bird and blazoned shield."</pre><h5>XLIII</h5></div> </div>
