In this, he perishes amid that slaughter;
And, what breeds most affliction, dies by water.</pre><h5>CXXV</h5><pre>Lewis the Provencal is cleft in two;
Arnold of Thoulouse through the breast before;
Hubert of Tours, sir Dionysius, Hugh,
And Claud, pour forth their ghosts in reeking gore.
Odo, Ambaldo, Satallon ensue,
And Walter next; of Paris are the four â€”
With others, that by me unmentioned fall,
Who cannot tell the name and land of all.</pre><h5>CXXVI</h5><pre class="  ">The crowd, by Rodomont of Sarza led,
The ladders lift, and many places scale.
Here the Parisians make no further head,
Who find their first defense of small avail
Full well they know that danger more to dread
