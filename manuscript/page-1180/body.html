The stirrups lost; and in her sight, so well
Beloved, appeared about to quit the sell.</p><blockquote><p>CIII</p></blockquote><p>But as steel arbalest that's loaded sore,
By how much is the engine charged and strained,
By lever or by crane, with so much more
Fury returns, its ancient bent regained,
And, in discharging its destructive store,
Inflicts worse evil than itself sustained;
So rose that African with ready blade,
And straight with double force the stroke repaid.</p><blockquote><p>CIV</p></blockquote><p>Rodomont smites, and in the very place
Where he was smit, the Tartar in return;
But cannot wound the Sarzan in the face,
Because his Trojan arms the weapon turn;
Yes so astounds, he leaves him not in case,
If it be morn or evening to discern.
Rodomont stopt not, but in fury sped
A second blow, still aiming at his head.</p><blockquote><p>CV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
