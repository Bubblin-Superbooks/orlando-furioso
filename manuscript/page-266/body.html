Somedeal projecting from the colonnade,
In which is not a single part but glows,
With rarest gems of India overlaid.
Propp'd at four points, the portal did repose
On columns of one solid diamond made.
Whether what met the eye was false or true,
Was never sight more fair or glad to view.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXII</p></blockquote><pre><code>Upon the sill and through the columns there,
Ran young and wanton girls, in frolic sport;
Who haply yet would have appeared more fair,
Had they observed a woman's fitting port.
All are arrayed in green, and garlands wear
Of the fresh leaf.  Him these in courteous sort,
With many proffers and fair mien entice,
And welcome to this opening Paradise:</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
