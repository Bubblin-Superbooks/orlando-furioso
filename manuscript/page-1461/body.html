(Whereof a third is from my memory gone)
So well one story in my head imprest,
It could not be more firmly graved in stone:

Which hits the opinion that I hold, aright?
That I may hear thee speak with better ease
Sit so, that I may have thee in my sight."</pre><blockquote class="  "><p>Canto</blockquote></div> </div>
