Now underneath a hill by fountain cast,
They read the amorous lays of ages past:</pre><h5>XXXII</h5><pre>Now by glad hill, or through the shady dale,
They hunt the fearful hare, and now they flush

Wild pheasant from the stubble-field or bush.
Now where green junipers perfume the gale,
Suspend the snare, or lime the fluttering thrush:
And casting now for fish, with net or book,
Disturb their secret haunts in pleasant brook.</pre><h5>XXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">Rogero revels there, in like delight,
While Charles and Agramant are troubled sore.
But not for him their story will I slight,
