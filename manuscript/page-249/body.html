In riches other princely domes excel,
As that the gentlest, fairest, company
Which the whole world contains, within it dwell:

As the bright sun outshines each lesser star.</p><blockquote><p>XI</p></blockquote><p>Her shape is of such perfect symmetry,

Is scattered, of the lily and the rose.
Like ivory smooth, the forehead gay and round
Fills up the space, and forms a fitting bound.</p><blockquote><p>XII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Two black and slender arches rise above
