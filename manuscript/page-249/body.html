Sir cavalier, and will with me repair,
You shall behold the wonders of my chace,
And note the different sorts of fish I snare;
Shaggy or smooth, or clad in scales of light,
And more in number than the stars of night:</code></pre><blockquote><p>XL</p></blockquote><pre><code>" 'And would you hear a mermaid sing so sweet,
That the rude sea grows civil at her song,
Wont at this hour her music to repeat,
(With that she showed the monster huge and long
— I said it seemed an island — as her seat)
Pass with me where she sings the shoals among.'
I, that was always wilful, at her wish,
I now lament my rashness, climb the fish.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XLI</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>"To Dudon and Rinaldo's signal</pre></div> </div>
