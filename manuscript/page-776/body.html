God grant, fair sir, he never may confound
Your eyesight with his semblance foul and stern!
Better it is of him by fame to hear,
Than to behold him by approaching near.</pre><h5>XXX</h5><pre>"To calculate the griesly monster's height,
(So measureless is he exceeds all skill; ) 

Of fungus-hue, in place of orbs of sight,
Their sockets two small bones like berries fill.
Towards us, as I say, he speeds outright
Along the shore, and seems a moving hill.
Tusks jutting out like savage swine he shows,
A breast with drivel foul, and pointed nose.</pre><h5>XXXI</h5><pre class="  ">"Running, the monster comes, and bears his snout
In guise of brach, who enters on the trail.
