The king, than is the king that champion true.
After with friendly cheer and equal glee
Had once or twice embraced the noble two,
To Oberto Roland told the treachery
Which had been done the youthful dame, and who
Had done it, — false Bireno — that among
All men should least have sought to do her wrong.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXIV</p></blockquote><pre><code>To him he told the many proofs and clear
By which the dame's affection had been tried;
And how she for Bireno kin and geer

And how he this could warrant, and appear
To vouch for much, as witness on her side.
While thus to him her griefs Orlando showed,
The lady's shining eyes with tears o'erflowed.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
