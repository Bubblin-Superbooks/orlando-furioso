You, am I happy in his daughter's love.'</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXI</p></blockquote><pre><code>" `Of what a strange mistake,' (to him replied
The duke `your foolish passion is the root! ) 

You think yourself beloved; I, on my side,
Believe the same; this try we by the fruit.
You of your own proceeding nothing hide,
And I will tell the secrets of my suit:
And let the man who proves least favoured, yield,
Provide himself elsewhere, and quit the field.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXII</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>" `I am prepared, if such your wish, to swear
Nothing of what is told me to reveal;
And will that you assure me, for your share,
You shall what I recount as well</pre></div> </div>
