Heedless alike of order, sex, and age.</pre><h5>XXVI</h5><pre>Nor the impious king alone with human blood,
— Lord of the impious he — his hand distains,
But even on walls so sorely vents his mood,
He fires fair houses, and polluted fanes.
The houses almost all were made of wood,

Six out of ten no better builded see.</pre><h5>XXVII</h5><pre class="  ">Though flames demolish all things far and wide,
This ill appears his furious hate to slake:
Where'er the paynim has his hands applied,
He tumbles down a roof at every shake.
My lord, believe, you never yet espied
