And wheresoe'er he turns his haughty front,
Appears (so loud the deafening crash and groan)
As if he were uprending wood and mount,
Intent to make him his bold deed atone,
Cymosco at the pass expects the count;
As soon as he appears, with ready light
Touches the hole, and fires upon the knight.</p><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote><p>Behind, the weapon flames in lightning's guise,
And vents the thunder from before; the ground
Shakes under foot and city wall; the skies
The fearful echo all about rebound.
The burning bolt with sudden fury flies,
Not sparing aught which in its course is found.
Hissing and whizzing through the skies it went;
But smote not, to the assassin's foul intent.</p><blockquote><p>LXXVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Whether it was his great desire to kill
That baron, or his hurry made him fail,
Or trembling heart, like leaf</p></div> </div>
