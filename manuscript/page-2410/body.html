Was done; nor should he be so ill appaid,
That from him should his plighted wife be torn;
And nought thereof unto the warrior said;
And on whoever lists she will in strife
Prove Bradamant to be Rogero's wife;</pre><h5>CIV</h5><pre>And this, before all others, will prove true

For she had to Rogero, in her view,
Spoken those words, which they that marry swear;
And with all ceremony wont and due
So was the contract sealed between the pair,
They were no longer free; nor could forsake
The one the other, other spouse to take.</pre><h5>CV</h5><pre class="  ">Whether Marphisa true or falsely spake,
I well believe that, rather with intent
