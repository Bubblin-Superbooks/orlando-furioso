With long-descending beard she clothed her chin,
And wrinkled o'er her front and other skin.</pre><h5>LII</h5><pre>To imitate his speech, and face, and cheer,
She knew so well, that, by the youth descried,
She might the sage Atlantes' self appear;
Next hid, and watched so long, that she espied
Upon a day (rare chance the cavalier ) 

At length detached from his Alcina's side:
For still, in motion or at rest, the fay
Ill bore the youth should be an hour away.</pre><h5>LIII</h5><pre class="  ">Alone she finds him, fitting well her will,
As he enjoys the pure and morning air
Beside a brook, which trickled from a hill,
Streaming towards a limpid lake and fair.
