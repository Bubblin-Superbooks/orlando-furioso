Parry the stroke, who scarce discern their swords.</pre><h5>XXVI</h5><pre>He of Mount Alban is the first to say,
They should not combat darkling, on the plain;
But should their duel till such time delay
As slow Arcturus should have turned his wain.
(And adds, as safely as himself might stay )

As duly tended, honoured, and well seen,

And thither the united warriors speed,
Where lies Mount Alban's troop in chosen post.
From his attendant squire a goodly steed,
