Unless perchance he thinks it praise and gain,
By such illustrious warriors to be slain."</pre><h5>LXXIV</h5><pre class="  ">When they by Ulany were certified

Who with a deeper black than pitch had dyed
Their honour, heretofore so fair of show;
And more than ten her story testified,
Where one sufficed â€” with such o'erwhelming woe
Were they possest, they with such fury burned,
