But when he saw the Child without a spear,
He flang is own far from him, in disdain
To take such vantage of the cavalier.
Admiring at Sir Dudon's courteous vein,

"And of those perfect warriors must be one
That as the paladins of France are known.</pre><h5>LXXVIII</h5><pre>"If I my will can compass, he shall shew
His name, to me, ere further deed be done."

And from the Child as courteous answer won.

A bold defiance speak, and come to blows.</pre></div> </div>
