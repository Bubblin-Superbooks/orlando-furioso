While aye more passing proud and arrogant,
Waxes in rage and threat the tempest fell.
And now three days the angry gale has blown,
Nor signal of abatement yet has shown.</pre><h5>XLIV</h5><pre>Waves lifted by the waxing tempest start
Castle and flooring, and, if yet there be
Aught standing left in any other part,
'Tis cut away and cast into the sea.
Here, pricking out their course upon the chart,
One by a lantern does his ministry,
Upon a sea-chest propt; another wight
Is busied in the well by torch's light.</pre><h5>XLV</h5><pre class="  ">This one beneath the poop, beneath the prow
That other, stands to watch the ebbing sand;
And (each half-glass run out returns to know )
