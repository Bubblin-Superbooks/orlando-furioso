<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>He of the fight has told which at Belgrade
Erewhile Rogero for the Bulgars won;
How Leo and his sire were overlaid,
And all their army slaughtered and undone;
Wherefore the Bulgars him their king had made;
Their royal line excluding from the throne:
Then how Ungiardo took the warrior brave,
And him to cruel Theodora gave.</p><blockquote><p>LI</p></blockquote><p>He speaks with that of certain news, which say
How good Rogero's jailer was found dead,
The prison broke and prisoner away:
Of what became of him was nothing said.
â€” Towards the city by a secret way
(Nor was his visage seen Rogero sped. )</p><p>He, on the following morning, and his friend,
Leo, to Charles's court together wend.</p><blockquote><p>LII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">To Charles' court he wends; the bird he bore
Of gold</p></div> </div>
