Asked young Rogero and those damsels twain,
And prayed she would in courtesy pursue,
Yea, rather from the first her tale explain.
"That castle's lord, fierce, and inhumane,
Yet for a while his wicked heart concealed,
Nor what he was so suddenly revealed.</pre><h5>XLV</h5><pre>"For in the lifetime of his sons, a pair
That differed much from the paternal style,
(Since they the stranger loved; and loathers were
Of cruelty and other actions vile)

And there were gentle deeds performed this while:
For. albeit avaricious was the sire,
He never crossed the youths in their desire.</pre></div> </div>
