<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">An alabaster palace by her art,
Gilded within, without, and everywhere.
So wonderful, no tongue could tell, no heart
Conceive, how rich within, without how fair:
That, which thou deemed so fair, my master's home,
Is but a cottage to that costly dome.</pre><h5>CXXXIII</h5><pre>"Curtain and cloth of arras deck the wall,
Sumptuously woven and in different wise,
In vaulted cellar and in littered stall;
Not only spread in latticed galleries,
Not only spread in lordly bower and hall.
Vase, gold and silver, gems of many dyes,
Carved into cup and charger, blue, red, green,
And countless cloths of silk and gold are seen.</pre><h5>CXXXIV</h5><pre class="  ">"He chanced upon the costly dome (as I
To you was in my story making known)
