Thou sayest to save him from what stars foreshow,
And cheat an evil influence of the skies
Rogero is confined.  Thou canst not know,
Or knowing, canst not change his destinies:
For, if unknown an ill so near to thee,
Far less mayest thou another's fate foresee.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXVI</p></blockquote><pre><code>"Seek not thy death from me; for the petition
Is made in vain; but if for death thou sigh,
Though the whole world refused the requisition,
A soul resolved would find the means to die.
But ope thy gates to give thy guests dismission
Before thine hand the knot of life untie."
So spake the scornful dame with angry mock,
Speeding her captive still towards the rock.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXVII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
