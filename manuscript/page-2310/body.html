The greater portion of those griding blows
From biting to the quick, through plate and chain,
He with more fury, with more rage o'erflows,
Than in mid winter the tempestrous main
Flings down his shield, and with both hands outright
Lays at Rogero's helm with all his might.</p><blockquote><p>CXXII</p></blockquote><p>With that excessive force, wherewith the gin,
Erected in two barges upon Po,
And raised by men and wheels, with deafening din
Descends upon the sharpened piles below,
With all his might he smote the paladin
With either hand; was never direr blow:
Him the charmed helmet helped, or — such its force —
The stroke would have divided man and horse.</p><blockquote><p>CXXIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">As if about to fall, the youthful lord
Twice nodded,</p></div> </div>
