<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre>Bold Salinterno, mid the warlike train,
Was in the lists, vizier and marshal hight,
Who had the government of all that reign,
And was, withal, a puissant man of might:
The tourney's prize he sees, with much disdain,
About to be borne off by foreign knight.
A lance he snatches, and to Gryphon cries,
And him with many menaces defies.</pre><h5>XCVIII</h5><pre>But he makes answer with a massy spear,
Out of ten others chosen as the best;
And levelling at the buckler of the peer,
For greater surety, pierces plate and breast.
'Twixt rib and rib, it bored the cavalier,
Issuing a palm behind.  To all the rest,
The king excepted, welcome was the blow:
For each was greedy Salinterno's foe.</pre><h5>XCIX</h5></div> </div>
