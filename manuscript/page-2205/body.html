<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">One that for loftiness of mind would be
Worthy all praise, if he avoided thee.</pre><h5>II</h5><pre>Some earth and sea and heaven above us square,
Know Nature's causes, works, and properties;
What her beginnings, what her endings are;
And soar till Heaven is open to their eyes:
Yet have no steadier aim, no better care,
Stung by thy venom, than, in sordid wise,
To gather treasure: such their single scope,
Their every comfort, and their every hope.</pre><h5>III</h5><pre class="  ">Armies by him are broken in his pride,
And gates of warlike towns in triumph past:
The foremost he to breast the furious tide
Of fearful battle; to retire the last;
Yet cannot save himself from being stied
Till death, in thy dark dungeon prisoned fast.
