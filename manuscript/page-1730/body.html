The valiant Francis, foremost of his train,
Who so shall break the haughty Switzer's horn,
That little short of spent their bands remain;
And them shall nevermore the style adorn,
Usurped by that foul troop of churlish vein,
Of scourge of princes, and the faith's defence,
To which those rustics rude shall make pretence.</pre><h5>XLIV</h5><pre>"Lo!  he takes Milan, in the league's despite:
Lo!  with the youthful Sforza makes accord:
Lo!  Bourbon the fair city keeps, in right
Of Francis, from the furious German horde:
Lo!  while in other high emprize and fight
Elsewhere is occupied his royal lord,
Nor knows the pride and license of his host,
Through these the city shall anew be lost.</pre><h5>XLV</h5></div> </div>
