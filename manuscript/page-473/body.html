With all things that befitted his design:
His arms he left behind, except his blade,
And singly for the rocky island made.</pre><h5>XXXII</h5><pre>Home to his breast the count pulls either oar,
With the island at his back, to which he wends,
In guise that, crawling up the sandy shore,
The crooked crab from sea or marsh ascends.

The rising sun her yellow hair extends
(His orb as yet half-seen, half-hid from sight)
Not without stirring jealous Tithon's spite.</pre><h5>XXXIII</h5><pre class="  ">Approaching to the naked rock as near
As vigorous hand might serve to cast a stone,
He knew not if he heard, or did not hear
A cry, so faint and feeble was the moan.
