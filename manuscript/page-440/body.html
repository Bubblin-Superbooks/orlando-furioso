As that which now upon her bosom fed:
And hence she made her followers ply the oar
Till the white foam on either bank was shed
The deafening noise and din o'er sea and shore,
By echo every where repeated, spread,
"Now â€” now, Rogero, bare the magic shield,
Or in the strife be slain, or basely yield":</code></pre><blockquote><p>L</p></blockquote><pre><code>Thus Logistilla's pilot; and beside,
So saying, seized the pouch, wherein was dight
The buckler, and the covering torn aside,
Exposed to open view the shining light.
The enchanted splendor, flashing far and wide,
So sore offends the adversaries' sight,
They from their vessels drop amazed and blind,
Tumbling from prow before, and poop behind.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
