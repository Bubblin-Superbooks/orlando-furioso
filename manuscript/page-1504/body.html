And other wealthy towns, not far aloof.
The village was upon a river's side,
So that its every need might be supplied.</pre><h5>XCV</h5><pre>Here standing, full of thought, upon a day,
(Such was his common wont the paynim spied, ) 

Advancing by a narrow path, which lay
Through a green meadow, from the adverse side,
A lovely damsel, that upon her way
Was by a bearded monk accompanied;
And these behind them led a lusty steed,
Who bore a burden, trapt with sable weed.</pre><h5>XCVI</h5><pre class="  ">Who that attendant monk and damsel were,
And what that burden, will to you be clear,
Remembering Isabella is the fair,
