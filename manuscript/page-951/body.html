Better than steel that man will bide the assay,
— Of marble breast — who has not now his fears.
Marphisa, erst so confident 'mid harms,
Denied not but that day she felt alarms.</pre><h5>XLVIII</h5><pre>A pilgrimage is vowed to Sinai,
To Cyprus and Gallicia, and to Rome,
Ettino, and other place of sanctity,
If such is named, and to the holy tomb.
Meanwhile, above the sea and near the sky,
The bark is tost, with shattered plank and boom;
From which the crew had cut, in her distress,
The mizenmast, to make her labour less.</pre><h5>XLIX</h5><pre class="  ">They bale and chest and all their heavy lumber
Cast overboard, from poop, and prow, and side;
And every birth and cabin disencumber
