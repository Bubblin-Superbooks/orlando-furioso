He here with Richardetto would be found.</pre><h5>LVI</h5><pre>And, for to her well known was that repair,
Used by her often, she herself addrest
Towards the fount, and in that quarter fair
Found him, and in what manner, was exprest;
But like embassadress, who — wise and ware —
Better than was enjoined performs a hest,
When Richardetto she beheld, made show
As if she good Rogero did not know.</pre><h5>LVII</h5><pre class="  ">She turned her wholly to Sir Richardet,
As bound direct to him; and, on his side,
He who well knew her, straight uprose and met,
And asked that damsel whitherward she hied.
Hippalca, with her eyes yet red and wet
