And found himself within a gloomy wood:
Where a rough mountain reared its shaggy back,
Whose stony peak above the forest stood;
The daughter of Dodona's duke behind,
Dogging his footsteps through the thicket blind.</p><blockquote><p>LXIX</p></blockquote><p>He, when he saw himself within the brake,
Thought to abandon his unweeting foe;
And to the dame â€” " 'Twere better that we make
For shelter ere the gathering darkness grow;
And, yonder mountain past, (save I mistake)
A tower is seated in the vale below.
Do you expect me then, while from the peak
I measure the remembered place I seek."</p><blockquote><p>LXX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">So said, he pushed his courser up the height
Of that lone mountain; in his evil mind
Revolving, as he went, some scheme or sleight
To rid him of the gentle dame</p></div> </div>
