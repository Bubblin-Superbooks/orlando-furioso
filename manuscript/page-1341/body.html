Came out of nether hell; when on the plain,
Common before, men fixed the landmark's bound,
And fashioned written pacts with jealous pain;
Yet walked not every where, at first, her round:
Unvisited she left yet many a reign:
Through diverse places in our time she wends;
But the vile rabble and the crowd offends.</pre><h5>XLI</h5><pre class="  ">"From the beginning even to our day,
Aye has that monster grown, and aye will grow;
And till much time be past will grow alway:
