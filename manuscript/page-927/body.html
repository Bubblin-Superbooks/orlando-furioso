The others, deem that to return to Crete
Is in their sad estate the wiser lore,
Throwing themselves at sire and husband's feet,
Than in those wilds, and on that desert shore,
To pine of want.  Another troop repeat,
They should esteem it were a worthier notion
To cast themselves into the neighbouring ocean;</p><blockquote><p>XXIV</p></blockquote><p>"And lighter ill, if they as harlots went
About the world, â€” beggars or slaves to be,
Than offer up themselves for punishment,
Well merited by their iniquity.
Such and like schemes the unhappy dames present,
Each harder than the other.  Finally,
One Orontea amid these upstood,
Who drew her origin from Minos' blood.</p><blockquote><p>XXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
