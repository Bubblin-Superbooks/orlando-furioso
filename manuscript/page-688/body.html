Forewarned of this by the good hermit's rede.
Here to his horn for succour he applied,
Nor failed its wonted virtue in this need:
It smote the giant's heart with such affright,
That he turned back, and homeward fled outright.</pre><h5>LIV</h5><pre>Astolpho blew, still watchful of surprise,
Weening to see the engine sprung: fast flew

Hampers the wretch, and drags him to the ground.</pre><h5>LV</h5><pre class="  ">Astolpho, who beholds his bulky prey
Fall bodily, drives thither at full speed,
