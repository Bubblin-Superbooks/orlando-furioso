Put from the other shore with punctual aim,
As if forewarned and well prepared, the seer
Waited the coming of the cavalier.</pre><h5>XLIV</h5><pre>The ferryman put forth the Child to meet,
To bear him to a better shore rejoicing: he
Appeared as all benign and all discreet,
If of the heart the face is warranty.
Giving God thanks, Rogero took his seat
Aboard the bark, and passed the quiet sea,
Discoursing with that ancient pilot, fraught
With wisdom, and by long experience taught.</pre><h5>XLV</h5><pre class="  ">He praised Rogero much, that he had fled
In time from false Alcina, and before
To him the dame had given the chalice dread,
Her lover's final guerdon evermore.
