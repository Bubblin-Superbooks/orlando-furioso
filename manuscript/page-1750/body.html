The warrior's manly shoulders and his breast,
Fair face and movements full of graceful shew;
And then the maid, with mickle spite possest,
Thinking another joys the stripling's love,
Thus speaks, as sovereign rage and fury move.</p><blockquote><p>XXXII</p></blockquote><p>"Shall then another kiss those lips so bright
And sweet, if those fair lips are lost to me?
Ah!  never other shall in thee delight;
For it not mine, no other's shalt thou be.
Rather than die alone and of despite,
I with this hand will slay myself and thee,
That if I lose thee here, at least in hell
With thee I to eternity may dwell.</p><blockquote><p>XXXIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"If thou slay'st me, there is good reason, I
The comfort too of vengeance should obtain;
In that all edicts and all equity
The death of him that causes death ordain;
Nor, since you justly, I unjustly, die,
Deem I</p></div> </div>
