Upon their deadly battle so intent,

Hearing a mighty noise, both champions turn,
And good Baiardo, sore bested, discern.</pre><h5>LXXXIV</h5><pre class="  ">They good Baiardo by a monster view,

The monster's beak; a bat in all the rest.
Equipt with feathers, black as ink in hue,
And piercing talons was the winged pest;
An eye of fire it had, a cruel look,
