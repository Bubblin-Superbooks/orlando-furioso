Equalled by none amid that countless store;
And when and whose such glorious life should be,
Longed sore to know.  "This," (said the apostle hoar,
Concealing nothing of its history,)
"Shall have existence twenty years before,
Dating from THE INCARNATE WORD, the year
Shall marked my men with M and D appear;</pre><h5>V</h5><pre class="  ">"And, as for splendor and for substance fair,
