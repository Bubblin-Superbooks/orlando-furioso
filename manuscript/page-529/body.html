"Help, help!" entreating cries, and weeping sore,
"More than for life and soul, alas!  of thee
Protection for my honour I implore.
Then shall it in my Roland's presence be
Ravished by this foul robber?  Oh! before
Me to such miserable fate you leave,
Let me from your own hand my death receive!"</code></pre><blockquote><p>XVI</p></blockquote><pre><code>These words repeated once, and yet again,
Made Roland through each chamber, far and near,
Return with passion, and with utmost pain;
But tempered with high hope.  Sometimes the peer
Stopt in his search and heard a voice complain,
Which seemed to be Angelica's:  if here
The restless warrior stand, it sounds from there,
And calls for help he knows not whence nor where,</code></pre><blockquote><p>XVII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
