While this, whom more propitious saints befriend,
Safe through the grass drags off its slimy trail.
Dire was the stroke; yet should no wonder breed,
Since good Orlando's arm achieved the deed.</pre><h5>XL</h5><pre>Those whom the board had little maimed or nought,
(Turpin says there were seven in craven wise, ) 

Their safety in their feet, yet vainly, sought;
For to the cavern's door Orlando hies.
And having them without resistance caught,
Fast with a rope their hands behind them ties;
A rope, which in the cavern on the ground,
Convenient for his purpose he had found.</pre><h5>XLI</h5><pre class="  ">He after drags them bound without the cave,
Where an old service-tree its shadow throws.
