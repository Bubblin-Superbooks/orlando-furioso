Without revenge, against whom shall I turn?
For I, besides myself, none other see
That hath inflicted on me scathe and scorn.
Then I to take revenge for all the harm
Done to myself, against myself must arm.</pre><h5>LXXXVIII</h5><pre>"Yet was but to myself this injury done,
Myself to spare (because this touched but me)
I haply could, yet hardly could, be won;
Nay, I will say outright, I could not be.
Less can I be, since not to me alone,
But Bradamant, is done this injury;
Even if I could consent myself to spare,
It fits me not unvenged to leave that fair.</pre><h5>LXXXIX</h5><pre class="  ">"Then I the damsel will avenge, and die,
(Nor this disturbs me whatsoe'er betide; )
