<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Bidding adieu to salvage Guido's wife,
And to the four, her comrades in the strife:</pre><h5>CIII</h5><pre>Saying she deems unfitting for a knight
To fare in like great fellowship; that so
The starlings and the doves in flock unite,
And every beast who fears â€” the stag and doe;
But hawk and eagle, that in other's might
Put not their trust, for ever singly go;
And lion, bear, and tyger, roam alone,
Who fear no prowess greater than their own.</pre><h5>CIV</h5><pre class="  ">But none with her opine, and, in the lack
Of a companion, singly must she fare,
So then, alone and friendless, she a track
Uncouth pursues, and through a wooded lair.
Gryphon the white and Aquilant the black
Take road more beaten with the other pair;
