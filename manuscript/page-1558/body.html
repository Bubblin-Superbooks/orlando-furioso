If held so lightly be a breach of vow â€”
Beneath what burden will thy heart be bent?
What treatment will thine adversary know,
If one who loves like me thou so torment?
Justice is none in heaven, I well may say,
If Heaven its vengeance for my wrongs delay.</p><blockquote><p>XLI</p></blockquote><p>"If of all human sins of deepest dye

For this, the fairest angel of the sky
Was banished into foul and darksome part;
If mighty sins for mighty vengeance cry,
Where due atonement cleanses not the heart;
Beware lest thou beneath such vengeance groan,
Ingrate!  that wouldest not thy sin atone.</p><blockquote><p>XLII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Cruel Rogero, I of theft, beside
All other sins, may justly thee arraign.
