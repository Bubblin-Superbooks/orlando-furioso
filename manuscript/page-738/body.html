But shows, by doings, what he is in name;
â€” With what rare grace and matchless art he wars,
The son of Aymon, rather son of Mars.</pre><h5>XLVI</h5><pre>Well-matched in skill, they aimed their cruel blows,
With lances at each other's heads addrest;
Ill matched, in arms and valour, were the foes,
For this past on, and that the champaigne prest.
More certain proof of worth, when warriors close,
There needs than knightly lance, well placed in rest;
But Fortune even more than Valour needs,
Which ill, without her saving succour, speeds.</pre><h5>XLVII</h5><pre class="  ">With the good spear new levelled in his fist,
At Oran's king behold Rinaldo dart.
Of bulk, and bone, and sinew, to resist
The monarch was, but ill supplied with heart.
