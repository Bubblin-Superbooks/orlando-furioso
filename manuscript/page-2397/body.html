Where shifting he the hostile hand espied.
Either he smote her not, or — die he smite —
Smote, where he deemed least evil would betide.
The lady, ere the westering sun descend,
Desires to bring that duel to an end.</pre><h5>LXXVIII</h5><pre>Of the edict she remembered her, and knew
Her peril, save the foe was quickly sped:
For if she took not in one day nor slew
Her claimant, she was taken; and his head
Phoebus was now about to hide from view,
Nigh Hercules' pillars, in his watery bed,
When first she 'gan misdoubt her power to cope
With the strong foe, and to abandon hope.</pre><h5>LXXIX</h5><pre class="  ">By how much more hope fails the damsel, so
Much more her anger waxes; she her blows
