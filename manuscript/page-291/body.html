For much his kindred and the courteous prayer
Of good Rogero with Melissa weighed.
Beside his prayers, the ring Rogero gave;
That him she by its aid might better save.</p><blockquote><p>XVII</p></blockquote><p>Thus by Rogero's suit the enchantress won,
To his first shape transformed the youthful peer;

Of gold, which whensoe'er at tilt he run,
At the first touch unseated cavalier;

And source of mighty fame to both in France.</p><blockquote><p>XVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The sage Melissa found this spear of gold,
Which now Alcina's magic palace graced,
And other armour of the warrior bold,
Of which he was in that ill dome uncased.
She climbed the courser of the wizard</p></div> </div>
