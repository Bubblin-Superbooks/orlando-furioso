The first was this, for riches and for might;
But he with all his puissance, all his treasure,
Alas!  had miserably lost his sight.
And yet was this the monarch's least displeasure;
Vexed by a direr and a worse despite;
Harassed, though richest of those Nubian kings,
By a perpetual hunger's cruel stings.</pre><h5>CVIII</h5><pre>Whene'er to eat or drink the wretched man
Prepared, by that resistless need pursued,
Forthwith — infernal and avenging clan —
Appeared the monstrous Harpies' craving brood;
Which, armed with beak and talons, overran
Vessel and board, and preyed upon the food;
And what their wombs suffice not to receive
Foul and defiled the loathsome monsters leave.</pre></div> </div>
