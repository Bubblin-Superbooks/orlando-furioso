Melissa, when the hosts are mixed in fight
By her false phantoms, vanishes from sight.</pre><h5>VIII</h5><pre>The champions two, that, against all accord,
Against all faith, disturbed their duel see,
No longer strive in fight, but pledge their word
— Yea, put aside all hostile injury —
That they, on neither part, will draw the sword,
Until they better certified shall be
Who broke the pact, established by that twain,
Young Agramant, or aged Charlemagne.</pre><h5>IX</h5><pre class="  ">They sweat anew, the king who had o'erthrown
That truce, and broken faith, as foe to treat.
The field of combat is turned upside down;
Some hurry to the charge, and some retreat.
Who most deserved disgrace, who most renown,
