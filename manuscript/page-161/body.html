To say what on her head such evil drew;
And, to save time, commands his squire to stoop,
And take the damsel on his horse's croup.</p><blockquote><p>LXXII</p></blockquote><p>And as the lady nearer he surveyed,

And she began to tell in humble tone</p><blockquote><p>Canto I postpone.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
