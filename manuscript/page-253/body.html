So witched, Rogero sure some grace deserves,
If from his faith his frail affection swerves.</p><blockquote><p>XIX</p></blockquote><p>At board lyre, lute and harp of tuneful string,
And other sounds, in mixed diversity,
Made, round about, the joyous palace ring,
With glorious concert and sweet harmony.
Nor lacked there well-accorded voice to sing
Of love, its passion and its ecstasy;
Nor who, with rare inventions, choicely versed,
Delightful fiction to the guests rehearsed.</p><blockquote><p>XX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">What table, spread by whatsoever heir
Of Ninus, though triumphant were the board,

Could with this banquet's matchless joys compare,
By the fond fairy for Rogero stored?
