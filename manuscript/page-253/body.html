Beholding her so courteous and so fair.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XLVII</p></blockquote><pre><code>"Clasped in her dainty limbs, and lapt in pleasure,
I weened that I each separate good had won,
Which to mankind is dealt in different measure,
Little or more to some, and much to none.
I evermore contemplated my treasure,
Nor France nor aught beside I thought upon:
In her my every fancy, every hope
Centered and ended as their common scope.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XLVIII</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>"By her I was as much beloved, or more;
Nor did Alcina now for other care;
She left her every lover; for before,
Others, in truth, the fairy's love did share:
I was her close adviser</pre></div> </div>
