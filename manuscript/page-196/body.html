And yet might vouch, to the prosperity
And honour of the king, and of his land,
To please so well that monarch, as to be
By him accounted worthy of the hand
Of his fair child, espoused with his consent:

Nor I intruder fear, encroaching nigh;
Nor seek I more; 'tis here my hopes I bound;

Seek surer sign of it than what is found,
By God allowed, in wedlock's lawful tie;
And other suit were hopeless, am I sure,
So excellent she is, and passing pure.'</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXVI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
