So well one story in my head imprest,
It could not be more firmly graved in stone:
And what I thought and think, would be professed
For that ill sex, I ween by every one
Who heard; and, Sir — if pleased to lend an ear —
To their confusion yon that tale shall hear."</p><blockquote><p>CXL</p></blockquote><p>"What could'st thou offer which could better please
At present" (made reply the paynim knight)

Which hits the opinion that I hold, aright?
That I may hear thee speak with better ease
Sit so, that I may have thee in my sight."</p><blockquote><p>Canto I unfold
What to King Rodomont the landlord told.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
