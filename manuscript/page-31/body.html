Deaf to his prayer, but flew with better speed.
Furious, in chase of him, Rinaldo hies.
But follow we Angelica, who flies.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXIII</p></blockquote><pre><code>Through dreary woods and dark the damsel fled,
By rude unharboured heath and savage height,
While every leaf or spray that rustled, bred
(Of oak, or elm, or beech), such new affright,
She here and there her foaming palfrey sped
By strange and crooked paths with furious flight;
And at each shadow, seen in valley blind,
Or mountain, feared Rinaldo was behind.</code></pre><blockquote><p>XXXIV</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>As a young roe or fawn of fallow deer,

Has seen a hungry pard or tiger</pre></div> </div>
