To breast divides, and thence to paunch below.</p><blockquote><p>CXXIV</p></blockquote><p>Down from the wall Andropono and Moschine
He cast into the ditch: a priest the first;
The second, but a worshipper of wine,
Drained, at a draught, whole runlets in his thirst;
Aye wonted simple water to decline,
Like viper's blood or venom: now immersed
In this, he perishes amid that slaughter;
And, what breeds most affliction, dies by water.</p><blockquote><p>CXXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Lewis the Provencal is cleft in two;
Arnold of Thoulouse through the breast before;
Hubert of Tours, sir Dionysius, Hugh,
And Claud, pour forth their ghosts in reeking gore.
Odo, Ambaldo, Satallon ensue,
And Walter next; of Paris are the four â€”
With others, that by me unmentioned fall,
Who cannot tell the name</p></div> </div>
