But breaking-down the gate, their entrance made;
Bireno to the count with courtesy
And grateful thanks the service done repaid.
Thence they, together with large company,
Went where Olympia in her vessel stayed:
For so was the expecting lady hight,
To whom that island's crown belonged of right.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXXV</p></blockquote><pre><code>She who had thither good Orlando brought,
Not hoping that he would have thriven so well;
— Enough for her, if by her misery bought,
Her spouse were rescued from the tyrant's cell! —
Her, full of love and loyal homage, sought
The people one and all:  Twere long to tell
How she caressed Bireno, he the maid, —
What thanks both lovers to the county paid.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXXVI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
