Till living wight remained not in his view.
Orlando doubted to resume his way,
Although the country all about he knew.
Does he the right or left-hand road assay,
His thoughts still rove from what his steps pursue,
And he to seek the damsel is in dread
Through other path than that by which she fled.</pre><h5>LXXXVI</h5><pre>Through wood and field his courser did he goad,
Often inquiring for the royal dame:
Beside himself, he strayed beside his road,
And to the foot of rising mountain came,
Whence (it was night-time through a fissure glowed ) 

The distant flicker of a quivering flame.
Orlando to the rock approached, to spy
If there Angelica concealed might lie.</pre></div> </div>
