On sage Sobrino and the king of Spain,
— Eldest and wisest they those lords among —
The monarch so bespeaks the assembled throng:</p><blockquote><p>XXXVIII</p></blockquote><p>"Albeit if fits not captain, as I know,
To say, `on this I thought not,' this I say;
Because when from a quarter comes the blow,
From every human forethought far away,
'Tis for such fault a fair excuse, I trow;
And here all hinges; I did ill to lay
Unfurnished Africk open to attack,
If there was ground to fear the Nubian sack.</p><blockquote><p>XXXIX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"But who could think, save only God on high
Prescient of all which is to be below,
That, from land, beneath such distant sky,
Such mighty host would come, to work us woe?
'Twixt shifting sands, which restless whirlwinds blow:
Yet they their camp have round Biserta placed,
And laid the better part of Africk</p></div> </div>
