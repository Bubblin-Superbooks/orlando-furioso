Could ne'er contaminate her honest will.</pre><h5>XCIII</h5><pre>"Her fearful husband still embracing close,
Her arms about his neck Argia threw:
A burst of tears her visage overflows:
For from her eyes two streams their way pursue.
She grieves, he guilty should his wife suppose;
As if she hath already been untrue:
For his suspicion to its source she traced;
That in her faith no faith Anselmo placed.</pre><h5>XCIV</h5><pre class="  ">"Citing their long farewell, I should exceed.
`— To thee at length,' he so the dame addrest,
`I recommend my honour'; — and indeed
Took leave, and on his road in earnest prest;
And truly felt, on wheeling round his steed,
As if his heart was issuing from his breast.
