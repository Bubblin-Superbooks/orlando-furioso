Of Syria's king, pulled down, and to his slight.
Of his champions England's cavalier,

But little of those arms, pursued the peer,

And Sansonnet had armed to aid the dame. )</pre><h5>CXXIV</h5><pre>While he and Gryphon stood in colloquy,
Aquilant came, and knew Astolpho good,
Whom he heard speaking with his brother nigh,
And, though of evil purpose, changed his mood.

But came not nigh the warriors where they stood:
And seeing them in conference, stood clear,
Listening, in silence, and intent to hear.</pre></div> </div>
