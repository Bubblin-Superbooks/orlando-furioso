Together with that lady, as he says,
Where in weak post and with unequal force
King Agramant the Christian army stays.

And close and anxious there, until the day
Which was to bring her joy or sorrow, lay.</p><blockquote><p>XC</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">This while Mount Alban's prince and castellain,
