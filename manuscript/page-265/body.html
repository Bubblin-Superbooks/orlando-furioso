<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">fair,
A beast than spotless ermine yet more white;
So lovely were the damsels, and so rare
Their garb, and with such graceful fashion dight,
That he who closely viewed the youthful pair,
Would need a surer sense than mortal sight,
To judge between the two.  With such a mien
Embodied Grace and Beauty would be seen.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXX</p></blockquote><pre><code>Into the mead rode this and the other dame,
Where the foul crew opposed the Child's retreat.
The rabble scattered as the ladies came,
Who with extended hand the warrior greet.
He, with a kindling visage, red with shame,
Thanked the two damsels for their gentle feat;
And was content upon their will to wait,
With them returning to that golden gate.</code></pre><blockquote><p>LXXI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
