But I to bitter warfare wake anew;
Sweet sleep but brought with it fallacious joy,
But — sure and bitter — waking ills ensue.
If falsehood so delight and truth annoy,
Never more may I see or hear what's true!
If sleeping brings me weal, and watching woe,
The pains of waking may I never know!</p><blockquote><p>LXIV</p></blockquote><p>"Blest animals that sleep through half the year,
Nor ope your heavy eyelids, night nor day!
For if such tedious sleep like death appear,
Such watching is like life, I will not say,
Since — such my lot, beyond all wont, severe —
I death in watching, life in sleep assay.
But oh!  if death such sleep resemble, Death,
Even now I pray three stop my fleeting breath!"</p><blockquote><p>LXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The clouds were gone, the horizon overspread
