<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Rinaldo steers,
Breathing forth piteous sighs which seem of flame;
And, if he joins Orlando — ere they part —
Swears in his fury he will have his heart.</p><blockquote><p>XIX</p></blockquote><p>So, passing where the prompt Bayardo stood,
Leaps on his back, and leaves, as swift as wind,
Without farewell, his rival in the wood;
Much less invites him to a seat behind.
The goaded charger, in his heat of blood,
Forces whate'er his eager course confined,
Ditch, river, tangled thorn, or marble block;
He swims the river, and he clears the rock.</p><blockquote><p>XX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Let it not, sir, sound strangely in your ear
Rinaldo took the steed thus readily,
So long and vainly followed far and near;
For he, endued with reasoning faculty,
Had not in vice lured on the following peer,
But fled before his cherished lord, that he
Might guide him</p></div> </div>
