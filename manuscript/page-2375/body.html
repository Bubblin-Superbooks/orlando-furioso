Not quelled and routed would she be, but slain.</pre><h5>XXXIV</h5><pre>"I am like miser, so intent on gear,
And who hath this so buried in his heart,
That he, for hoarded treasure still in fear,
Cannot live gladly from his wealth apart.
Since I Rogero neither see nor hear,
More puissant far than Hope, O Fear!  thou art;
To thee, though false and idle I give way;
And cannot choose but yield myself thy prey.</pre><h5>XXXV</h5><pre class="  ">"But I, Rogero, shall no sooner spy
The light of thy glad countenance appear,
Against mine every credence, from mine eye
Concealed (and woe is me), I know not where, â€”
Oh!  how true Hope false Fear shall from on high
Depose withal, and to the bottom bear!
