"Nought shalt thou hear, thy comfort to assure.
Isabel has not yielded up her breath,
But lives a life she would exchange for death.</pre><h5>CXLI</h5><pre>"She, since thou heardest of her destiny,
Within few days, has fallen into the power
Of more than twenty.  If restored to thee,
Think now, if thou hast hope to crop her flower."

Yet knowest it is false!  Her virgin dower
Secure from brutal wrong, would none invade,
Though in the power of twenty were the maid."</pre><h5>CXLII</h5><pre class="  ">Questioning of the maid, he when and where
She saw her, vainly asked the beldam hoar,
Who, ever restive to Zerbino's prayer,
To what she had rehearsed would add no more.
