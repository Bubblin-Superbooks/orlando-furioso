Deem I that thine is equal to my pain.
I him who seeks my life, alas!  shall spill,
Thou her that loves and worships thee wouldst kill.</pre><h5>XXXIV</h5><pre>"My hand, why hast thou not the hardiment
To rive with steel the bosom of my foe,
That me so many times to death has shent,
Under the faith of love, in peaceful show;
Him, who to take my life can now consent,
Nor even have pity of my cruel woe?
Dare, valiant heart, this impious man to slay,
And let his death my thousand deaths appay!"</pre><h5>XXXV</h5><pre class="  ">So said, she spurred at him amid the throng;
But, first — "Defend thee, false Rogero!" — cried.
"No more, if I have power, in spoil and wrong,
Done to a virgin heart, shalt thou take pride."
