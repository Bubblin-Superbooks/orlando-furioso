But not an inch the champions backward bent.</pre><h5>XIV</h5><pre>The chargers such a rough encounter made,
That on his crupper sank each staggering horse:
Rinaldo's rose so quick, he might be said
Scarcely to interrupt his rapid course:

When his lord sees him slain, he leaves his seat,
And in an instant springs upon his feet;</pre><h5>XV</h5><pre class="  ">And to his foe, that having wheeled anew,
Approached with hand unarmed, the warrior cried:

Because, whenas he lived, he was my pride,

If thus unvenged by my good arm he died;
