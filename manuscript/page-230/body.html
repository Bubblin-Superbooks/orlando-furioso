Long of the king and court entreated sore,
At length the covering helmet did remove,
And showed a visage often seen before,
The cherished face of Ariodantes true,
Of late lamented weeping Scotland through;</code></pre><blockquote><p>IV</p></blockquote><pre><code>Ariodantes, whom with tearful eye
His brother and Geneura wept as dead,
And king, and people, and nobility:
Such light his goodness and his valour shed.
The pilgrim therefore might appear to lie
In what he of the missing warrior said.
Yet was it true that from a headland, he
Had seen him plunge into the foaming sea.</code></pre><blockquote><p>V</p></blockquote><pre class="  "><code>But, as it oft befalls despairing</pre></div> </div>
