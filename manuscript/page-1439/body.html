So that his visage reddened at the slight:
He would, in person, follow her at speed,
And to his utmost power avenge the deed.</pre><h5>XCVI</h5><pre>But the wise king, Sobrino, who was by,
Him from the quest endeavoured to dissuade,
And that with his exalted majesty
Such enterprize were ill assorted said:
Although firm hope, nay full security,
He had to overcome that martial maid,
If he with pain subdued a woman, shame,
Rather than honour, would pursue his name.</pre><h5>XCVII</h5><pre class="  ">Small profit and much peril would succeed
From any fight he should with her maintain,
(And he advised him as the better deed, )
