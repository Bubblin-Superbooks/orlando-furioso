<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h5>CXXI</h5><pre>Who, after feat so base and foul, anew
Approaches, with such front and shameless cheer,
— And cries, "It seems a thing unheard, that you,
An excellent and worthy cavalier,
Should take this man for your companion, who
Has not in all our wide Levant his peer.
Did you with him for contrast-sake combine,
That so your valour might more brightly shine?</pre><h5>CXXII</h5><pre>"— But did not love for you my will restrain,
By the eternal gods, I truly swear,
He should endure such ignominious stain,
As I am wont to make his fellows share:
Him would I make of my long-nursed disdain
Of cowardice perpetual record bear.
To you, by whom he hither was conveyed,
If now unpunished, let his thanks be paid."</pre></div> </div>
