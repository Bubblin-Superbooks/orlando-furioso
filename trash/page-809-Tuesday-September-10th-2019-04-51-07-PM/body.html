His brother he in vile Martano spied.
For arms and vest, more white than virgin snow,
The coward in the warrior's sight belied,
And sprang towards him, with that joyful "Oh!"
By which delight is ever signified;
But changed his look and tone, when, nearer brought
He sees that he is not the wight he sought:</p><blockquote><p>LXXIX</p></blockquote><p>And through that evil woman's treachery,
Deemed Gryphon murdered by the cavalier;
And, "Tell me," he exclaimed, "thou, who must be
Traitor and thief — both written in thy cheer —
Whence are these arms?  and wherefore do I thee
View on the courser of my brother dear?
Say is my brother slaughtered or alive?
How didst thou him of horse and arms deprive?"</p><blockquote><p>LXXX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
