With the melodious Muses, to allay
Their thirst at Aganippe's well, have gone,
And still are going; who so fairly speed,
That we more theirs than they our labour need.</p><blockquote><p>XV</p></blockquote><p>If I of these would separately tell,
And render good account and honour due,
More than one page I with their praise should swell,</p><blockquote><p>Canto shew;
And if on five or six alone I dwell,
I may offend and anger all the crew.
What then shall I resolve? to pass all by?
Or choose but one from such a company?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>XVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">One will I choose, and such will choose, that she
All envy shall so well have overthrown,
No other woman can offend be,
If, passing others, her I praise alone:
Nor joys this one but immortality,
Through her sweet style (and better know I none):
But who is honoured in her</p></div> </div>
