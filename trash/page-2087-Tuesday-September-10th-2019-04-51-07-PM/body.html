That thought moved thought, which others moved again)
In memory chances on the knight to dwell,
That him at supper late did entertain;
That, through this city's cause, the truth to tell,
Hath reason evermore to be in pain;
And of the magic vessel him bethinks
Which shows his consort's guilt to him that drinks;</p><blockquote><p>LXV</p></blockquote><p>And him bethinks therewith of what the knight
Related; how of all that he had tried,
Who of his goblet drank, there was no wight
But split the wine he to his lips would guide.
Now he repents him; now, "'Tis my delight,"
(Mutters "that I the proof would not abide: )</p><p>Succeeding I should prove but what I thought;
And not succeeding, to what pass am brought!</p><blockquote><p>LXVI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
