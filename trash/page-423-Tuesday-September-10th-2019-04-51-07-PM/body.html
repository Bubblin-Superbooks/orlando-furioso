<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">repaired:
Firm stood Rogero, and the veil undone,
Appeared to give the sky another sun.</p><blockquote><p>CX</p></blockquote><p>He in the monster's eyes the radiance throws,
Which works as it was wont in other time.
As trout or grayling to the bottom goes
In stream, which mountaineer disturbs with lime;
So the enchanted buckler overthrows
The orc, reversed among the foam and slime.
Rogero here and there the beast astound
Still beats, but cannot find the way to wound.</p><blockquote><p>CXI</p></blockquote><p>This while the lady begs him not to bray
Longer the monster's rugged scale in vain.
"For heaven's sake turn and loose me" (did she say,
Still weeping "ere the orc awake again. )</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Bear me with thee, and drown me in mid-way.
Let me not this foul monster's food remain."
By her just</p></div> </div>
