Through many a messenger, with joyful shout
And mickle haste, the happy tidings went.
Hence the warm blood, that stagnated about
Her heart, by her first sorrow thither sent,
Ebbed at this notice in so full a tide,
Well nigh for sudden joy the damsel died.</p><blockquote><p>LXVI</p></blockquote><p>Of all her vigour is she so foregone,

Yet what her force must needs to you be known,
And what the damsel's magnanimity.
None doomed to prison, wheel or halter, none
Condemned some other evil death to die,
About whose brows the sable band is tied,
Rejoices more to hear his pardon cried.</p><blockquote><p>LXVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Joys Clermont's, joys Mongrana's noble house,
