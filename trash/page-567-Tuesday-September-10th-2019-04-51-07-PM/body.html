As gift, a courser of a chestnut stain,
Whose legs and mane were sable; he was bred
Between a Friesland mare and nag of Spain.
King Mandricardo, armed from foot to head,
Leapt on the steed and galloped o'er the plain,
And swore upon the camp to turn his back
Till he should find the champion clad in black.</p><blockquote><p>XXXV</p></blockquote><p>The king encounters many of the crew
Whom good Orlando's arm had put to flight;
And some a son, and some a brother rue,
Who in the rout had perished in their sight;
And in the coward's cheek of pallid hue
Is yet pourtrayed the sad and craven sprite:
â€” Yet, through the fear endured, they far and nigh,
Pallid, and silent, and insensate fly.</p><blockquote><p>XXXVI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
