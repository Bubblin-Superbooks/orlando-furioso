Have styled as of a triple form, and who
Thy sovereign beauty dost in heaven, and hell,
And earth, in many forms reveal; and through

Show where my king, amid so many lies,
Who did, alive, thy holy studies prize."</p><blockquote><p>CLXXXV</p></blockquote><p>At the youth's prayer from parted cloud outshone

Christian or Saracen, was Paris-town
Seen in that gleam, and hill and plain's extent.
With these Mount Martyr and Mount Levy's height,
This on the left, and that upon the right.</p><blockquote><p>CLXXXVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The silvery splendor glistened yet more clear,
