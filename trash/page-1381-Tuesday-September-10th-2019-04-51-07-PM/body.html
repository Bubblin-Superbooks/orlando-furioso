And to the king such injury proclaim:
But willed that like himself he should forego
Revenge upon the author of that shame.
Hence, that he might discern her guilt, yet spare,
He made him on the Agnus Dei swear.</p><blockquote><p>XLI</p></blockquote><p>"He made him swear that he, for nothing said,
Or seen, which might to him displeasing be,
(Though he, in what he should discover, read
An outrage offered to his majesty,)
Would, now or ever, venge him on his head:
Moreover him he bound to secrecy;
That the ill doer ne'er, through deed or word,
Might guess his injured king that case had heard.</p><blockquote><p>XLII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"The monarch, who to every thing beside
Could better have given credit, freely swore:

Why he had many days lamenting</p></div> </div>
