To hardy herd as well as naked swain;

And found it the abode of grief and pain;
And place of sojourn more accursed and fell,
On that unhappy day, than tongue can tell.</p><blockquote><p>CII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Turning him round, he there, on many a tree,
Beheld engraved, upon the woody shore,
What as the writing of his deity

This was a place of those described by me,
Whither ofttimes, attended by Medore,
