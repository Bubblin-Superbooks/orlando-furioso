Maugre the valour which his deeds display,
So firmly, as to wait the Christian band,
In number less, but steadier in array,
More used to joust and manage of the brand,
And all things appertaining to the gray.

Zumara and Canaries' islesmen fled.</p><blockquote><p>XLIX</p></blockquote><p>But faster than the rest Alzerba flies,
Whom Dardinel opposed, and now with sore
Reproach, and now with prayer he moves, and tries
What best he deems their courage may restore.

"That you should by his memory set such store,
Now shall be seen â€” be seen, if you will me,
His son, abandon in such jeopardy.</p><blockquote><p>L</p></blockquote></div> </div>
