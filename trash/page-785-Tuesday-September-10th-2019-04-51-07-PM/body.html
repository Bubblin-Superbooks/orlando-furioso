Should go, did Pride with her as well repair;
And she (for all were guested in one bower)
In search of her had little way to fare.
Pride went with her; but, that in hall or tower,
A vicar too her charge might duly bear,

For her lieutenant left Hypocrisy.</p><blockquote><p>XXVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The implacable Discord went, and with the dame,

Comfortless Jealousy, with whom there came
A little dwarf, attending as a guide;
Who erst had been sent forward with advice
