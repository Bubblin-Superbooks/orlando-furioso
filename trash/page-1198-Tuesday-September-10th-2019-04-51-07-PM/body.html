Who have in this their error had to learn;
Nor father, brother, nor even mother me
From her (such our resemblance can discern. )</p><p>'Tis true, this hair, which short and loose you see,
In many guise, and hers, with many a turn,
And in long tresses wound about her brow,
Wide difference made between us two till now.</p><blockquote><p>XXIV</p></blockquote><p>"But since the day, that, wounded by a Moor
In the head (a story tedious to recite)
A holy man, to heal the damsel's sore,
Cut short to the mid-ear her tresses bright,
Excepting sex and name, there is no more
One from the other to distinguish; hight
I Richardetto am, Bradamant she;
Rinaldo's brother and his sister we.</p><blockquote><p>XXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
