As queen was called, and this for thee forewent;
Where both my brethren and my sire were slain,
And every other good from me was rent? â€”
Thee would I not, thou ingrate, with my pain
Reproach, not therefore deal thee punishment:
As well as I, the story dost thou know;
Now, see the meed thou dost for this bestow!</p><blockquote><p>XXXIII</p></blockquote><p>"Oh!  may I but escape the wild corsair,
Nor taken be, and after sold for slave!
Rather than this may lion, wolf, or bear,
Tiger, or other beast, if fiercer rave,
Me with his claws and rushes rend and tear,
And drag my bleeding body to his cave."
So saying she her golden hair offends,
And lock by lock the scattered tresses rends.</p><blockquote><p>XXXIV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
