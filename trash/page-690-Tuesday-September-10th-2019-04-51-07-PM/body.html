For the Scots only ply the murderous spear;
Only the scattered paynims slaughtered lie,
As if conducted thither but to die.</p><blockquote><p>LIII</p></blockquote><p>It seemed as if each coward paynim grew
More cold than ice, each Scot more fierce than flame.
The Moors believed that with Rinaldo's thew

Nor stayed till herald should his call proclaim:
Better were they than those which went before,
For captain, armour, and for martial lore.</p><blockquote><p>LIV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Less worthless men of Africa were they,
Though ill had they been deemed of much avail.

Forthwith King Dardinel, the foe to assail,
Moved up his host, himself in helmet gay,
And sheathing all his limbs in plate and mail.
