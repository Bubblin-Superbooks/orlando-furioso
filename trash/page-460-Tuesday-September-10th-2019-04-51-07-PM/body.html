Naked that beauteous form; for sure it were
He never could have been so stern of mood,
As to have left her on that desert lair.
That Ireland's king was fired I well conclude,
Nor hid the flame that he within him bare.
He strives to comfort her, and hope instill,
That future good shall end her present ill.</p><blockquote><p>LXXIII</p></blockquote><p>And her to Holland promises to bear,
And vows till she is to her state restored,
And just and memorable vengeance there
Achieved upon her perjured, traitor lord,
He never will unceasing war forbear,
Waged with all means that Ireland can afford;
And this with all his speed.  He, up and down,
Meantime bids seek for female vest and gown.</p><blockquote><p>LXXIV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Now will it need to send in search of vest
