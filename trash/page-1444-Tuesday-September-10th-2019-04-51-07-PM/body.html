Upon the river's other margin fell;
At leisure may'st thou have her cured," (he said)
"And of no other fault have I to tell.
Give me thy hackney, with some boot instead:
Prythee, dismount thee, for he likes me well."
The peasant, laughing, answered not a word,
But left the fool and pricked towards the ford.</p><blockquote><p>VII</p></blockquote><p>"Hearest thou not?  hola!  I want thy steed,"
(Cried Roland and advanced with wrathful cheer. )</p><p>A solid staff and knotted, for his need,
That shepherd had, wherewith he smote the peer;
Whose violence and ire all bounds exceed,
Who seems withal to wax more fierce than e'er:
A cuff he levels at that rustic's head,
And splits the solid bone, and lays him dead.</p><blockquote><p>VIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
