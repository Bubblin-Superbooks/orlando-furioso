And showed a mournful face, and hung his head.
Next Farurantes; to whose care consigned,
Maurina's valiant horse and footmen tread.
The new-made king Libanio comes behind,
By whom are Constatina's people led:
Since Agramant the crown and staff of gold,
Once Pinador's, had given to him to hold.</p><blockquote><p>XXII</p></blockquote><p>Hesperia's people come with Soridan,
With Dorilon the men of Setta ride;
The Nasamonians troop with Pulian,
And Agricaltes is Ammonia's guide.
Malabupherso rules o'er Fezzan's clan,
And Finaduro leads the band supplied
By the Canary Islands and Morocco:
Balastro fills the place of king Tardocco.</p><blockquote><p>XXIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Next Mulga and Arzilla's legions two.
The first beneath their ancient captains wend;
The second troop</p></div> </div>
