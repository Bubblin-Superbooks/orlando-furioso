Upon that bridge's fearful pass, where one

Nor much their mighty strength or manege-lore
Avails the steeds; for, prostrate in the dust,
Crumbles each knight and charger in mid-course;
Whelmed in one fate, the rider and his horse.</p><blockquote><p>LXX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">When either steed would nimbly spring from</p></div> </div>
