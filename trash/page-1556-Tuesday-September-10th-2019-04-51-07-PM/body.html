And to her chamber breathing wrath returns.</p><blockquote><p>XXXVI</p></blockquote><p>Turned on her face, her body on the bed,
Armed as she is, th4e grieving damsel throws,
And that the sad lament by sorrow bred,
May be unheard of any, bites the clothes;
And so, repeating what the stranger said,
To such a pitcher her smothered anguish grows,
Her plaints no longer able to restrain,
So vents the maid parforce her piteous pain:</p><blockquote><p>XXXVII</p></blockquote><p>"Who ever can be trusted?  woe is me!
All false and cruel well may be esteemed,
If thou, Rogero, false and cruel be,
That I so pious and so faithful deemed.
What foul and felon act, what treachery,
Was ever yet by tragic poet dreamed,
But will fall short of thine, if thou wilt set
The sum of my desert, against thy debts?</p><blockquote><p>XXXVIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
