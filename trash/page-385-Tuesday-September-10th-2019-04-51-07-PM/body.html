At rising?  False Bireno!  cursed day
That I was born!  What here remains to me
To do?  What can be done? — Alone, betrayed —

That man inhabits in this isle; nor I
See ship, in which (a refuge from my woes),
Embarking, I from hence may hope to fly.
Here shall I starve; nor any one to close
My eyes, or give me sepulture, be by,
Save wolf perchance, who roves this wood, a tomb
Give me, alas!  in his voracious womb.</p><blockquote><p>XXIX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"I live in terror, and appear to see
