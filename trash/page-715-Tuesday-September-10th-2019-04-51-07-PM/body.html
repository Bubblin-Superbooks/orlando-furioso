Whom he had found in former peril true.
"Are you not those that erst with me did stand
'Gainst Agolant in Aspramont?  In you
Is vigour now so spent, (he said), the band,
Who him, Troyano, and Almontes slew,
With hundreds more, that you now fear to face
One of that very blood, that very race?</p><blockquote><p>XV</p></blockquote><p>"Why should I now in contest with the foe
Less strength in you behold than them?  Your might
Upon this hound (pursued the monarch show; )</p><p>This hound who preys on man. — A generous sprite
The thought of death — approach he fast or slow —
So that he dies but well, holds cheap and light.
But where you are, I doubt my fortune ill,
For by your succour, have I conquered still."</p><blockquote><p>XVI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
