As well Rogero the design to aid.</p><blockquote><p>XCVI</p></blockquote><p>Adding that he, in doing so, would do
What to his lord a faithful vassal owes;
Still, when the siege was raised, might they renew
And terminate their deadly strife by blows.
To him Rogero cried, "The fight with you
I freely will defer, till from his foes
King Agramant be rescued by the sword;
Provided first Frontino be restored.</p><blockquote><p>XCVII</p></blockquote><p>"Would you that I delay to prove by deed,
That you have acted in unworthy sort,
— Nor did, like valiant man, to take my steed
Thus from a woman — till we meet at court,
Render me my Frontino back, or read,
Upon no other ground, will I support
That battle shall not be between us two;
Nor will accord an hour of truce to you."</p><blockquote><p>XCVIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
