The lady these sad words, and more beside,
Lamenting aye; while her attendant maid
Nor once alone, but often, certified
The stripling would observe his faith, and prayed
Her — who could do no better — to abide
The Child's arrival till the time came round
When he by promise to return was bound.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXV</p></blockquote><p>The comfort that Hippalca's words convey,
And Hope, companion of the loving train,
Bradamant's fear and sorrow so allay,
That she enjoys some respite from her pain:
This moves her in Mount Alban's keep to stay;
Nor ever thence that lady stirred again
Until the day, that day the youthful knight
Had fixt, who ill observed his promise plight.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But in that he his promise ill maintained,
No blame</p></div> </div>
