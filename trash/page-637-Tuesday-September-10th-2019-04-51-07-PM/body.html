Far dearer than my life.  To the other side
Me vainly dost thou move to pass the wave;
Rather for this I seek the giant's cave.</p><blockquote><p>XLVII</p></blockquote><p>"I with dishonour life to flight may owe;
But worse than death loath thus to save my head.
The worst that can befall me if I go,
Is I my blood shall with the others shed:
But if on me such mercy God bestow,
That I remain alive, the giant dead,
Secure for thousands shall I make the ways;
So that the greater good the risque o'erpays.</p><blockquote><p>XLVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"I peril but the single life of one
Against safety of the countless rest."

And to thy succour, form among the blest,
May God dispatch the Archangel Michael down."
— And him, with that, the simple hermit blest.
