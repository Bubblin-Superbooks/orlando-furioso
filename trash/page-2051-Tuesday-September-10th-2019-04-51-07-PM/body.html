If she of charms or grace have fuller store,
Whether her visage most majestic shew,
Or beam with genius or with beauty more.
"He that would speak — would speak her praises true —
(Declares in fine the sculptured marble's lore)
The fairest of emprizes would intend,
But never bring his noble task to end."</p><blockquote><p>XCV</p></blockquote><p>Albeit such grace and passing sweetness shewed
Her fair and well wrought image, she disdain
Appeared to nurse, that one of wit so rude
Should dare to sing her praise in humble strain,
As he that only without comrade stood,
I know not why, her statue to sustain,
The marble all those other names revealed.
That pair's alone the artist had concealed.</p><blockquote><p>XCVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The statues in the middle form a round,
