He, now King Mandricardo is no more,
Esteems him the united world before.</p><blockquote><p>LXXI</p></blockquote><p>Nor to Rogero lean the men alone;
To him incline as well the female train,
Who for the land of France had left their own,
Amid the troops of Africk or of Spain;
And Doralice, herself, although she moan,
And for her lover, cold and pale, complain,
Save by the griding curb of shame represt,
Her voice, perchance, had added to the rest.</p><blockquote><p>LXXII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I say perchance, nor warrant it I dare,
Albeit the thing may easily be true;
For such his manners, such his merits are,
So beauteous is Rogero's form to view,
She (from experience we are well aware)
So prone to follow whatsoe'er is new,
That not to play the widow's</p></div> </div>
