<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This saker, culverine, or falcon hight,
I hear (all names the inventor has bestowed);
Which splits or shivers steel and stone outright,
And, where the bullet passes, makes a road.
â€” Down to the sword, restore thy weapons bright,
Sad soldier, to the forge, a useless load;
And gun or carbine on thy shoulder lay,
Who without these, I wot, shalt touch no pay.</p><blockquote><p>XXVI</p></blockquote><p>How, foul and pestilent discovery,
Didst thou find place within the human heart?
Through thee is martial glory lost, through thee
The trade of arms became a worthless art:
And at such ebb are worth and chivalry,
That the base often plays the better part.
Through thee no more shall gallantry, no more
Shall valour prove their prowess as of yore.</p><blockquote><p>XXVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Through thee, alas!  are dead, or have to die,
So many</p></div> </div>
