And piercing talons was the winged pest;

And, like ship-sails, two spreading pinions shook.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXV</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps it was a bird; but when or where
Another bird resembling this was seen

Except in Turpin, heard that such has been.

Evoked from depths of nether hell I ween;
Which Malagigi raised by magic sleight,
That so he might disturb the champions' fight.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">So deemed Rinaldo too: and contest sore

But he would not confess the charge; nay swore,
Even by the light which lights the glorious sun,
That he might clear him of the blame he bore,
He had not that which was imputed</p></div> </div>
