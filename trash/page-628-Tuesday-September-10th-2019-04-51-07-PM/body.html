I mark Hernando Cortez bring, 'mid these,

And kingdoms in the Orient so remote,
That we of these in India have no note.</p><blockquote><p>XXVIII</p></blockquote><p>"With Prospero Colonna, puissant peer,
A marquis of Pescara I behold; —
A youth of Guasto next, who render dear
Hesperia to the flower-de-luce of gold;

This third, who shall the laurel win and hold;
As a good horse before the rest will dart,
And first attain the goal, though last to start.</p><blockquote><p>XXIX</p></blockquote><p>"I see such faith, such valour in the deeds
Of young Alphonso (such his name confest, )</p><p>He in his unripe age, — nor he exceeds
His sixth and twentieth year, — at Caesar's hest,
