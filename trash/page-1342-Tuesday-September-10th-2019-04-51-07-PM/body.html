And even should the maid thy prayer deny,

And rather than that she desert thy side,
Let her hang him and every thief beside."</p><blockquote><p>XCIX</p></blockquote><p>Right willingly King Agramant gave way
To King Sobrino's counsel sage and staid;
And let renowned Marphisa wend her way,
Nor scathed he, nor let scathe, that martial maid,
Neither endured that any her should pray;
And heaven knows with what courage he obeyed
That wise advice, to calm such ruder strife
And quarrel, as throughout his camp were rife.</p><blockquote><p>C</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">At this mad Discord laughed, no more in fear
That any truce or treaty should ensue;
And scowered the place of combat there and here,
Nor could stand still, for pleasure at the view.
