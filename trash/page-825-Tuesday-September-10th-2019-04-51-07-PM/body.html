The flowers of spring-tide, yellow, blue, and red,
Finds itself, nor at concert or at ball
Dame beauteous and adorned, than 'mid the tread
Of warlike steeds, and din of arms, and fall
Of darts, and push of spears. — where blood is shed,
And death is dealt, in the tumultuous throng, —
SHE finds herself beyond all credence strong.</p><blockquote><p>CXIII</p></blockquote><p>She spurred her courser, and with lance in rest,
Imperious at the foolish rabble made,
And — through the neck impaled or through the breast, —
Some pierced, some prostrate at the encounter layed.
Next this or that she with the falchion prest;
The head from one she severed with the blade,
And from that other cleft: another sank,
Short of right arm or left, or pierced in flank.</p><blockquote><p>CXIV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
