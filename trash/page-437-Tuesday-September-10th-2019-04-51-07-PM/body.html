<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">day,
Guided a necromancer where it lay.</p><blockquote><p>XXIII</p></blockquote><p>More than a hundred fathom buried so,
Where hidden it had lain a mighty space,
The infernal tool by magic from below
Was fished and born amid the German race;
Who, by one proof and the other, taught to know
Its powers, and he who plots for our disgrace,
The demon, working on their weaker wit,
As last upon its fatal purpose hit.</p><blockquote><p>XXIV</p></blockquote><p>To Italy and France, on every hand
The cruel art among all people past:
And these the bronze in hollow mould expand,
First in the furnace melted by the blast:
Others the iron bore, and small or grand,
Fashion the various tube they pierce or cast.
And bombard, gun, according to its frame,
Or single cannon this, or double, name.</p><blockquote><p>XXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
