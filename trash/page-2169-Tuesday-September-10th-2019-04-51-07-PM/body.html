If what she will not do, she falsely say:

All guidance, great or small, is mighty Love.</p><blockquote><p>XL</p></blockquote><p>Deny she dared not, nor yet seem content;
So, sighed and spake not; but — when uncontrolled
She could — she gave her secret sorrow vent,
While from her eyes the tears like billows rolled;
A portion of the pains that her torment,
Inflicting on her breast and locks of gold:
For this she beat, and those uptore and brake;
And thus she made lament, and thus she spake.</p><blockquote><p>XLI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Ah!  shall I will what she wills not, by right
More sovereign mistress of my will than I?
Hers shall I hold so cheaply, so to slight
A mother's will, my own to satisfy?
Alas!  what blemish is so foul to sight
In damsel?  What so ill, as to affy
Myself to husband, reckless of her</p></div> </div>
