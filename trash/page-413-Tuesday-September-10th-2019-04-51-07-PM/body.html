Nor only England, Scotland, Ireland, aid
King Charlemagne; but to assist him wend
The Swede and Norse, and succours are conveyed
From Thule, and the farthest Iceland's end.
All lands that round them lie, in fine, increase
His host, by nature enemies to peace.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIX</p></blockquote><p>"Issued from cavern and from forest brown,

Visage, legs, arms, and bosom overgrown
With hair, like beasts.  Lo!  yonder, where they press
About a standard white, the level down
Of lances seems a bristling wilderness.
Such Moray's flag, the savage squadron's head,
Who means with Moorish blood to paint it red."</p><blockquote><p>XC</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">What time Rogero sees the fair array,
Whose bands to succour ravaged France prepare,
