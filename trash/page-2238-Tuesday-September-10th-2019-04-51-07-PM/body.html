Leo his arms about the cavalier;
And next his helmet from his head withdrew,
And kiss'd him on both cheeks with loving cheer.
"I would," he cried, "that thou wouldst ever do
By me what pleaseth thee; for thou wilt ne'er

To thee myself and state; these friendly spend;</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIV</p></blockquote><p>"Nor see I recompense, which can repay
The mighty obligation that I owe;
Though of the garland I should disarray
My brows, and upon thee that gift bestow."

Returns, and takes again his unicorn;</p><blockquote><p>LXXXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
