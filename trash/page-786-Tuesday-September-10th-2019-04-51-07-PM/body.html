<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">king, by beauteous Doralice.</p><blockquote><p>XXIX</p></blockquote><p>When she fell into Mandricardo's hand,
(I have before recounted when and where)
She had in secret given the dwarf command,
He to the king should with the tidings fare;
By whom she hoped not vainly would be scanned
The tale her messenger was charged to bear,
But wonderous deeds be done for her relief,
With sad and signal vengeance on the thief.</p><blockquote><p>XXX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Jealousy had that little dwarf espied,
And kenned the reason of his mission too,
And joined him, journeying with him side by side,
Deeming that she therein a part might do.
Discord, with pleasure, Jealousy decried,
But with more joy, when she the occasion knew
Which thither brought the dame, who much (she wist)
Might in the task she had in hand</p></div> </div>
