<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">stubble of the open lay,
What time the hunters seek the fearful hare
Through traversed woods, and through uncertain way,
â€” Lest peradventure she be hidden there,
They every bramble, every bush assay;
Even so, where hope the toiling warrior leads,
Searching his lady-love, Orlando speeds.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVIII</p></blockquote><p>Pricking in haste towards that ray, the count
Arrived where in the wood the light was shed,
Forth-streaming from a crevice in the mount,
Within whose womb a spacious grotto spread;
And there, like wall or bank, discerned in front,
Of thorns and underwood a bristly bed,
To hide the grotto's inmates, and defend
From scathe or scorn, which others might intend.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">By day it had been hidden evermore;
But the clear flame betrayed the haunt by night.
Its use he guessed;</p></div> </div>
