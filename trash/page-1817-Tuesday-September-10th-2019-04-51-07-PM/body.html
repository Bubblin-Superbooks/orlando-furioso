To have her in his power by every way;
And finally unhappy Avarice, bought

Who has all pity banished from his breast,
Had hither brought her, that his impious rage
That cruel man might on the hag assuage.</p><blockquote><p>XCII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">As the flood, swoln with Vesulo's thick snows,
