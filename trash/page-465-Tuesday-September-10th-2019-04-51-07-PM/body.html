Oppressed with grief and pain the County fares,
When a long cry, entering a forest hoar,
â€” A load lamenting smites upon his ears.
He grasps his brand and spurs his courser sore,
And swiftly pricks toward the sound he hears.
But I shall at another season say
What chanced, and may be heard in future lay.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
