This dance of folly; but yet cannot quit,
As quickly as I would, the faults I own;
For my disease has reached the very bone.</p><blockquote><p>IV</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Canto said before,
Orlando, furious and insensate wight,
Having torn off the arms and vest he wore,
And cast away from him his faulchion bright,
And up-torn trees, and made the forest hoar
And hollow cave resound, and rocky height,
Towards the noise some shepherds, on that side,
Their heavy sins or evil planets guide.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>V</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Viewing the madman's wonderous feats more near,
The frighted band of rustics turned and fled;
But they, in their disorder, knew not where,
As happens oftentimes in sudden dread.
The madman in a thought is in their rear,
Seizes a shepherd, and plucks off his head;
And this as easily as one might take
Apple from</p></div> </div>
