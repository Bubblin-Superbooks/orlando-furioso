Were the bright tresses which the hermit shore,
These, gathered in a knot, behind her head,
Though shorter than their wont, the damsel wore;
And he, that castle's master, plainly read,
(Who often had beheld her face before)
That this was Bradamant; and now he paid
Yet higher honours to the martial maid.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">With modest and with mirthful talk this while,
