So said, he cast away the weapon: fanned
Meanwhile, with flowing sheet, his frigate goes,
By wind, which for the cruel island blows.</p><blockquote><p>XCII</p></blockquote><p>Such was the paladin's desire to explore
If in the place his missing lady were;
Whom he prefers the united world before,
Nor can an hour of life without her bear.
He fears, if he set foot on Ireland's shore,
Some other chance may interrupt him there:
So that he after have in vain to say,
"Why hasted I no faster on my way?"</p><blockquote><p>XCIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Nor he in England nor in Ireland port
Will make, nor on the coast that's opposite.
But let him go, the naked archer's sport,
Sore smitten in the heart! â€” ere I indite
Yet more of him, to Holland I resort,
And you to hear me company invite.
For well I wot that you as well</p></div> </div>
