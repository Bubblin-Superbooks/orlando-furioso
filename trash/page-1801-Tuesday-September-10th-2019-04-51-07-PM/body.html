Of wife and life was plundered by that throng.</p><blockquote><p>LVI</p></blockquote><p>"Olindro slain, they led his lady fair
A captive thence, o'erwhelmed with sorrow so,
That she refused to live, and made her prayer,
Tanacro, as a grace, would death bestow:
Resolved to die, she leapt, in her despair,
From a high bank into a vale below;
But death was to the wretched dame refused;
Who lay with shattered head and sorely bruised.</p><blockquote><p>LVII</p></blockquote><p>"She could not to the castle be conveyed
