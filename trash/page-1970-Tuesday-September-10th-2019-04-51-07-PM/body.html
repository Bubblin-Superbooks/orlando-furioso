<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Roland roved, who paced the shore;
As I in other strain rehearsed before;</p><blockquote><p>XXV</p></blockquote><p>And willing to discover if alone,
Laden, or light, the stranded vessel were,
He, Olivier, and Monodantes' son,
Aboard her in a shallow bark repair:
Beneath the hatchways they descend, but none
Of human kind they see; and only there
Find good Frontino, with the trenchant sword
And gallant armour of his youthful lord;</p><blockquote><p>XXVI</p></blockquote><p>Who was so hurried in his hasty flight
He had not even time to take his sword;
To Orlando known; which, Balisardo hight,
Was his erewhile; the tale's upon record,
And ye have read it all, as well I wite;
How Falerina lost it to that lord,
When waste as well her beauteous bowers he laid;
And how from him Brunello stole the blade;</p><blockquote><p>XXVII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
