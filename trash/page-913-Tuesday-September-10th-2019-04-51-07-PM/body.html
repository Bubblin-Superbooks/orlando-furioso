Would ninety women wreak with vengeful spite;
And, save thou take my hospitality,
Except by them to be assailed this night."

(Replied Marphisa), "that the faith so plight,
And goodness of thy heart, will prove no less,
Than are thy corporal strength and hardiness.</p><blockquote><p>CV</p></blockquote><p>"But if, as having to kill me, thou grieve,
Thou well mayst grieve, for reasons opposite;
Nor hast thou cause to laugh, as I conceive,
Nor hitherto has found me worst in fight.
Whether thou wouldst defer the fray, or leave,
Or prosecute by this or other light,
Behold me prompt thy wishes to fulfil;
Where and whenever it shall be thy will!"</p><blockquote><p>CVI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
