If suddenly a falcon from the sky
Swoop mid the crowd, and one surprise and rend,
The rest dispersing, leave their mate to die,
And only to their own escape attend;
So scattering hadst thou seen the frighted throng,
When young Rogero pricked that crowd among.</p><blockquote><p>XIII</p></blockquote><p>Rogero smites the head from six or four,
Who in escaping from the field are slow.
He to the breast divides as many more,
And countless to the eyes and teeth below.
I grant no helmets on their heads they wore,
But there were shining iron caps enow;
And, if fine helmets did their temples press,
His sword would cut as deep, or little less.</p><blockquote><p>XIV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Such good Rogero's force and valour are,
As never now-a-days in warrior dwell;
Nor yet in rampant lion,</p></div> </div>
