Who was the stranger knight, so passing stout;
That not alone him bravely had gainsaid,
But oft endangered in that deadly bout;

In warfare so renowned all countries through.

Experience of a more redoubted wight.</p><blockquote><p>XXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">He gladly would be quit of the emprize
