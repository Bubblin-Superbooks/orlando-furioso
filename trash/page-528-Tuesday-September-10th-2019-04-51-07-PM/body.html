Threw it, and smote by chance the knave half blind,
Where with the nose the meeting brows confined.</p><blockquote><p>XXXVI</p></blockquote><p>The brand discharged by him, hit either brow,
But most severely on the left did smite;
For that ill feature perished by the blow,
Which was the thief's sole minister of light.
Nor is the stroke content to blind the foe;
Unsated, save it register his sprite
Among those damned souls, whom Charon keeps,
With their companions, plunged in boiling deeps.</p><blockquote><p>XXXVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">A spacious table in mid cavern stood,
Two palms in thickness, in its figure square;
Propt on one huge, ill fashioned food and rude,
Which held the thief and all who harboured there.
Even with such freedom as his dart of wood
We mark the nimble Spaniard launch</p></div> </div>
