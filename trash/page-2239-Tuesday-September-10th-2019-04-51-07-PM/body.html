From thence as quickly as he could withdrew,
And from young Leo's to his lodgings went;

Since broke by him alone is stubborn pain;
Nor saw, save Death, what other power could close
The account of his insufferable woes.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Whereof should I complain," he said, "wo is me!
