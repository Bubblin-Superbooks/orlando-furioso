Which so adorns and points poetic lore!
And, as renowned should be thy story rare,
Thousands and thousands of long years and more!

At the stupendous and unequalled feat,
And said: "I thee above that dame commend.
Whose death drove Tarquin from his royal seat;
And I to register a law intend,
'Mid those which ages change not as they fleet,
Which — I attest the inviolable river —
Unchanged through future times, shall last for ever.</p><blockquote><p>XXIX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"I will that all, in every future age,
Who bear thy name, be blest with genius high;
Be courteous, gentle, beautiful, and sage,
And to the real pitch of honour</p></div> </div>
