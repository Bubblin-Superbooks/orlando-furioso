Zerbino for Gabrina, who a heart
Of asp appears to bear, contends.  O'erthrown,
The Fleming falls upon the other part,
Through cause of that despised and odious crone,
He wounded sore, and writhing with the smart,
The beldam's treason to the prince makes known,
Whose scorn and hatred hence derive new force.
Towards loud cries Zerbino spurs his horse.</p><blockquote><p>I</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">No cord I well believe is wound so tight
Round chest, nor nails the plank so fastly hold,
As Faith</p></div> </div>
