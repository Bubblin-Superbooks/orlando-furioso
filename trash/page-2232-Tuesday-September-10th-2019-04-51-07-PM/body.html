Hammers and blunts the faulchion's tempered grain,
Lest it his opposite should cleave or bore.
She whets her steel, and into it would fain
Enter, that stripling to the quick to gore:
Yea, would such fury to her strokes impart,
That each should go directly to his heart.</p><blockquote><p>LXXI</p></blockquote><p>As on the start the generous barb in spied,
When he the signal full of fire attends;
And paws now here now there; and opens wide
His nostrils, and his pointed ears extends;
So the bold damsel, to the lists defied,
Who knows not with Rogero she contends,
Seemed to have fire within her veins, nor found
Resting-place, waiting for the trumpet's sound.</p><blockquote><p>LXXII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">As sometimes after thunder sudden wind
Turns the sea upside down; and far and nigh
Dim clouds of dust</p></div> </div>
