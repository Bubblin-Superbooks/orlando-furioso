<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Who, wearing out the weary night in sport,
— He and those followers that with him remained —
Had suffered thirst in such a grievous sort,
From the fierce fire in that small cave contained,
That drinking round, in measure full or short,
Of Graecian wine two barrels had they drained;
A booty which those squires who served the Moor,
From travellers seized a day or two before.</p><blockquote><p>XXII</p></blockquote><p>To Argier's warlike king, unused to wine,
(Cursed, and forbidden by his law, esteemed)
The liquor, tasted once, appeared divine,
Sweeter than nectar or than manna seemed:
He, quaffing largely, now of Ishmael's line
The sober use deserving censure deemed.
So fast their cups with that good wine they fill,
Each reveller's head is whirling like a mill.</p><blockquote><p>XXIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
