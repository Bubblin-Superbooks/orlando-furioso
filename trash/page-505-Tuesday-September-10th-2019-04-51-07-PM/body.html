Of the intrepid count, with stedfast hand,
Who, by the stroke unshaken, nothing reeled:

The starlings from the daring merlin flee;
So, of that broken squadron, scattered round,
Some fly, some dip, and some fall flat to ground.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">He ceased not his ensanguined blade to sway
