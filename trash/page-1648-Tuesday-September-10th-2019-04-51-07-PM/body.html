Within the gorgeous palace of the king.
Seated alone here guest and sovereign are,
And the attendant troop the viands bring.

The talon crook'd; rapacious is the hand;
Fetid and large the paunch; in many a fold,
Like snake's, their long and knotted tails are rolled.</p><blockquote><p>CXXI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The fowls are heard in air; then swoops amain
