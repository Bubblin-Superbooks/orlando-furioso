She on Rogero well might set her heart.</p><blockquote><p>LXXIII</p></blockquote><p>Though he did well alive, what could be done
With Mandricardo, after he was dead?

That her, by night or day, may bravely stead.

Already has ensured Rogero's life.</p><blockquote><p>LXXIV</p></blockquote><p>Agramant bids them diligently lay
The wounded warrior in his tent, and there
Is evermore beside him, night and day;

To his bed the Tartar's arms and buckler gay,
So bade the Moorish king, suspended were;
Suspended all, save trenchant Durindana,
Relinquished to the King of Sericana.</p><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
