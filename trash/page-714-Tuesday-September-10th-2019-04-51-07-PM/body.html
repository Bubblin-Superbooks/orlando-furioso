While every frighted beast before him flies.</p><blockquote><p>XII</p></blockquote><p>Nor bulwark, stone, nor arbalest, nor bow,
Nor what upon the paynim smote beside,
Sufficed to arrest the sanguinary foe;
Who broke and hewed, and shook that portal wide,
And in his fury let such day-light through,
'Twas easy to espy — and might be spied —
In visages o'ercast in death-like sort,
That full of people was the palace court.</p><blockquote><p>XIII</p></blockquote><p>Through those fair chambers echoed shouts of dread,
And feminine lament from dame distrest;
And grieving, through the house, pale women fled,
Who wept, afflicted sore, and beat their breast.
And hugged the door-post and the genial bed,
Too soon to be by stranger lords possest.
The matter in this state of peril hung
When thither came the king, his peers among.</p><blockquote><p>XIV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
