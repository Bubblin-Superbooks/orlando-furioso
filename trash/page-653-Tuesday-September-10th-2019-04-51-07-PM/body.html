If the two brethren nought the intent gainsay,</p><blockquote><p>LXXXI</p></blockquote><p>But willingly to him these yield the emprize,

And now a new Aurora climbs the skies,
And from his walls Orrilo on the plain

Of strokes would from the body at one blow
Divorce the spirit of the enchanted foe:</p><blockquote><p>LXXXII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Together with the mace he lops the fist;
And now this arm, now the other falls to ground;
Sometimes he cleaves the corslet's iron twist,
And piecemeal shares and maims the felon round.
Orrilo re-unites the portions missed,
Found on the champagne, and again is sound:
And, though into a hundred fragments</p></div> </div>
