And for her offspring watch, amid her ire.</p><blockquote><p>VIII</p></blockquote><p>Cloridan who to aid him knows not how,
And with Medoro willingly would die,
But who would not for death this being forego,
Until more foes than one should lifeless lie,
Ambushed, his sharpest arrow to his bow
Fits, and directs it with so true an eye,
The feathered weapon bores a Scotchman's brain,
And lays the warrior dead upon the plain.</p><blockquote><p>IX</p></blockquote><p>Together, all the others of the band
Turned thither, whence was shot the murderous reed;
Meanwhile he launched another from his stand,
That a new foe might by the weapon bleed,
Whom (while he made of this and that demand,
And loudly questioned who had done the deed)
The arrow reached â€” transfixed the wretch's throat,
And cut his question short in middle note.</p><blockquote><p>X</p></blockquote></div> </div>
