What time, from conquered Gaul returning home,
Julius stood fearing on the river-shore,
To ford the stream and make a foe of Rome,
He every banner would have bowed before
That dame, discharged his trophies, and such doom,
Such pact would have received as liked her best;
And haply ne'er had Freedom been opprest.</p><blockquote><p>VII</p></blockquote><p>The consort of my lord of Bozzolo
Behold!  the mother, sisters, cousinhood;
Them of Torello, Bentivoglio,
Pallavigini's and Visconti's brood!
Lo!  she to whom all living dames forego
The palm, and all of Grecian, Latin blood,
Or barbarous, all that ever were, whose name
For grace and beauty most is noised by Fame;</p><blockquote><p>VIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
