Where he, for whom he sought was used to dwell,
Who after thinking much, at last concluded

Their anthems, where they sleep, and where they sit
At meat; and everywhere in fine is writ.</p><blockquote><p>LXXX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Weening that he shall find him here, he plies

As soon as he has past the cloister's pale.
