For furtherance of his holy faith and true,
Against each other's breast the spear advance,
To the destruction of the faithful few.

And Switzers, turn your steps elsewhere , and you,
Ye Germans, worthier empire to acquire;
For that is won for Christ, which you desire.</p><blockquote><p>LXXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">If verily most Christian you would be,

Why slain by you Christ's people do I see?
Wherefore are they despoiled of their right?
Why seek you not Jerusalem to free
