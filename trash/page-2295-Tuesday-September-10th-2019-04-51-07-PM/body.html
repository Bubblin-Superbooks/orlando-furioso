Divides mid arts and wholesome discipline:
The secret spirit of the ancient page
There Fuscus well instructs him to divine:
"This must thou shun, that follow" — seems the sage
To say — "if thou immortally wouldst shine."
Fashioned withal with so much skill and care
By her who wrought that work, their gestures were.</p><blockquote><p>XC</p></blockquote><p>A cardinal he next is seen, though young
In years, at council in the Vatican;
Where for deep wisdom graced by eloquent tongue,
With wonder him the assembled conclave scan.

Themselves — "when he is ripened into man?
Oh!  if on him St. Peter's mantle fall,
What a blest aera!  what a happy call!"</p><blockquote><p>XCI</p></blockquote></div> </div>
