Wherewith that king received the English lord;
Who well remembered how the gentle knight
Had from the loathsome harpies freed his board.
But when the humour, that obscured his sight,
Valiant Astolpho scaled, and now restored
Was the blind sovereign's eyesight as before,
He would that warrior as a god adore.</p><blockquote><p>XXVIII</p></blockquote><p>So that not only those whom he demands
For the Bisertine war, he gives in aid;
But adds a hundred thousand from his bands,
And offer of his royal person made.
Scarce on the open plain embattled stands,
— All foot — the Nubian host, for war arraid.
For few the horses which that region bore;
Of elephants and camels a large store.</p><blockquote><p>XXIX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
