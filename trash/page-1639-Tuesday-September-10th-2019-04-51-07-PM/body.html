He viewed each regions in his spacious round;
He turned his back upon Carena hoar,
And skimmed above the Cyrenaean ground;
Passing the sandy desert of the Moor,
In Albajada, reached the Nubian's bound;

Bound for the Nubian city's royal pile;
Threading the two, where, ranged on either land,
Moslems and Christians watch,</p></div> </div>
