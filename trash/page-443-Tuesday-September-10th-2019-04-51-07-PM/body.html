Moved quickly to perform the feat he planned;
And, for he would the damsel's harm prevent,
And would with that assail the beast at hand,
Between her and the orc the boat he sent,
Leaving within the sheath his idle brand,
Anchor and cable next he takes in hold,
And waits the foe with constant heart and bold.</p><blockquote><p>XXXVII</p></blockquote><p>As soon as him the monster has descried,
And skiff at little interval, his throat
The fish, to swallow him, expands so wide,
That horse and horseman through his jaws might float.
Here Roland with the anchor, and beside
(Unless I am mistaken with the boat )</p><p>Plunged, and engulphed the parted teeth betwixt,
His anchor in the tongue and palate fixt;</p><blockquote><p>XXXVIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
