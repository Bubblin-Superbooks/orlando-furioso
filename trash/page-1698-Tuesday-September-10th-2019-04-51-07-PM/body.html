Yet will not I such mighty loss lament,
So that it drain no faster than before;

Wander my wits, and I with busy lip,
If I may have them back, these fain would sip.</p><blockquote><p>III</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Astolpho wandered through that palace wide,
Observing al the future lives around:

Upon the fatal wheel for finish wound,
He a fair fleece discerned that far</p></div> </div>
