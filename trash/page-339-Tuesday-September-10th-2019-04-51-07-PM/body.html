For such the name my faithful lover bore,
When Friesland's king, whose realm is from our own
No further than this stream from Ocean's shore,
Designing to bestow me on his son,
Arbantes hight (the monarch had no more),
To Holland sent the worthiest of his land,
Me of the count, my father, to demand.</p><blockquote><p>XXVI</p></blockquote><p>"I without power to falsify that vow,
Which to my gentle lover I had plight;
Nor though I had the power, would Love allow
Me so to play the ingrate, if I might,
(The treaty, well on foot, to overthrow,
And nigh concluded with afflicted sprite, )</p><p>Cried to my father, I would rather shed
My very life-blood, than in Friesland wed.</p><blockquote><p>XXVII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
