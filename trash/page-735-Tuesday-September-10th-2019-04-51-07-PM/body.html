Than might like the pretended beast's appear,

Her dread so mastered her, she screamed for fear,

Was known; nor can I well inform you how.</p><blockquote><p>LVII</p></blockquote><p>"So were we all intent on our own case,

Already her whom he had made his prize,
And force her to the cavern to retrace
Her steps: we, couching in our quaint disguise,
Wend with the flock, where us the shepherd leads,
Through verdant mountains, into pleasant meads.</p><blockquote><p>LVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"There we awaited, till beneath the shade
Secure, we saw the beaked orc asleep;
When one along the shore of ocean made,
And one betook him to the mountain</p></div> </div>
