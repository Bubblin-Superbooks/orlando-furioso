Him one or other cause so long detained,
The appointed time parforce he overpast:
On a sick bed, long time, he, sorely pained,
Was laid, wherein a month or more he past
In doubt of death; so deeply him had gored

And freed the captive pair to prison led.

Yet blended with some bitter is the sweet.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">For she had heard as well in that discourse,
For might and beauty voiced, Marphisa's praise;
