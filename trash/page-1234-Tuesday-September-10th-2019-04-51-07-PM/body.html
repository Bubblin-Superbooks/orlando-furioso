And free from chains, us Love and Pity sway."
He to that stranger next the reason shows
Why thus in steel their bodies they array.
"So just is the excuse which you oppose,"
— He answered — "that I ill should this gainsay,
And hold you surely for three cavaliers
That seldom upon earth will find their peers.</p><blockquote><p>VII</p></blockquote><p>"With you a lance or two I would have crost
To prove how great your prowess in the field;
But, since 'tis shown me at another's cost,
Forego the joust, and to your reasons yield.
Warmly I pray your leave against that host,
To join with your good arms this helm and shield;
And hope, if suffered of your band to be,
No worthless comrade shall you find in me."</p><blockquote><p>VIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
