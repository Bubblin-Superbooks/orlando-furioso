A fouler fosse was formed and worse to ford
Than girdles the infernal city round.
From house to house the fire in fury poured;
Mosque, portico, and palace, went to ground;
And spoiled and empty mansions with the clang,
Of beaten breast, and groan and outcry rang.</p><blockquote><p>XXXIV</p></blockquote><p>The victors, laden with their mighty prey,
From that unhappy city's gates are gone,
One with fair vase, and one with rich array,
Or silver plate from ancient altar won.
The mother this, that bore the child away;
Rapes and a thousand evil things were done.
Of much, and what they cannot hinder, hear
Renowned Orlando and fair England's peer.</p><blockquote><p>XXXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">By Olivier, amid that slaughter wide,
Fell Bucifaro of the paynim band;
And â€” every hope and comfort cast</p></div> </div>
