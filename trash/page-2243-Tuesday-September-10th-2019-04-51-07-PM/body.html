Were upon him bestowed, as were on thee.</p><blockquote><p>XCIV</p></blockquote><p>"Since to the gentlest maid, of fairest dye,
And boldest that hath been, or evermore
Will be, thou wast so dear, she used to tie
Thy trappings, and to thee thy forage bore:
Dear wast thou to my lady-love: Ah!  why
Call I her mine, since she is mine no more?
If I have given her to another lord,
Why turn I not upon myself this sword?"</p><blockquote><p>XCV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">If him these thoughts so harass and torment,
That bird and beast are softened by his cries;
(For, saving these, none hears the sad lament,
Nor sees the flood that trickles form his eyes)
You are not to believe that more content
The Lady Bradamant in Paris lies;
Who can no longer her delay excuse,
Nor Leo for her wedded lord</p></div> </div>
