Who passing little of its prisoner knows.</p><blockquote><p>CXXXIV</p></blockquote><p>The warrior's gyves no sooner they undo,
And from their manacles free either hand,
Than Gryphon seizes shield and sword, and, through
The rabble, makes long furrows with his brand.
With pike and spear unfurnished was the crew,
Who without weapons came, a witless band.</p><blockquote><p>Canto I suspend,
For, sir, 'tis time this song should have an end.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
