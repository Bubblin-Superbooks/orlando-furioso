In guise of brach, who enters on the trail.
We who behold him fly (a helpless rout),
Wherever terror drives, with visage pale.
'Tis little comfort, that he is without
Eye-sight, who winds his plunder in the gale,
Better than aught possest of scent and sight:
And wing and plume were needed for our flight.</p><blockquote><p>XXXII</p></blockquote><p>"Some here, some there make off, but little gain
By flying him; for swifter is the pest
Than the south wind.  Of forty, ten, with pain,
Swimming aboard the bark in safety rest.
Under his arm some wretches of our train
He packed, nor empty left his lap or breast:
And loaded a capacious scrip beside,
Which, like a shepherd's, to his waist was tied.</p><blockquote><p>XXXIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Us to his den the sightless monster</p></div> </div>
