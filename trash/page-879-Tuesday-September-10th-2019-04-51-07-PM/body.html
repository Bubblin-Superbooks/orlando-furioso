<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">your valour has availed to you!
Say what your honour boots, what goodly fee
Remunerates ye both, for service true!
Sirs, show me but a single courtesy,
With which she ever graced ye, — old or new, —
As some poor recompense, desert, or guerdon,
For having born so long so sore a burden!</p><blockquote><p>XXXII</p></blockquote><p>Oh! couldst thou yet again to life return,
How hard would this appear, O Agricane!
In that she whilom thee was wont to spurn,
With sharp repulse and insolent disdain.
O Ferrau, O ye thousand more, forlorn,
Unsung, who wrought a thousand feats in vain
For this ungrateful fair, what pain 'twould be
Could you within his arms the damsel see!</p><blockquote><p>XXXIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">To pluck, as yet untouched, the virgin rose,
Angelica permits the young Medore.
Was none so blest as in that</p></div> </div>
