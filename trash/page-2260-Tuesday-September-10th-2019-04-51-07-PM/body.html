Are led to the Ascraean font divine,
Julio Camillo; and meseems that I
Berna, and Sanga, and Flaminio spy.</p><blockquote><p>XIII</p></blockquote><p>Lo!  Alexander of Farnese, and O
Learned company that follows in his train!
Phaedro, Cappella, Maddalen', Portio,
Surnamed the Bolognese, the Volterrane.
Blosio, Pierio, Vida, famed for flow
Of lofty eloquence of exhaustless vein;
Mussuro, Lascari, and Navagero,
And Andrew Maro, and the monk Severo.</p><blockquote><p>XIV</p></blockquote><p>Lo!  two more Alexanders!  of the tree
Of the Orologi one, and one Guarino:
Mario d' Olvito, and of royalty
That scourge, divine Pietro Aretino.
I two Girolamos amid them see,
Of Veritade and the Cittadino;
See the Mainardo, the Leoniceno,
Panizzato, Celio, and Teocreno.</p><blockquote><p>XV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
