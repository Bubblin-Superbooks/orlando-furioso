And names of British lords, to him repair
One and another, crowding to survey
His courser, single of its kind, or rare:
All thither hasten, wondering and astound,
And compassing the warrior, form a round.</p><blockquote><p>XCI</p></blockquote><p>So that to raise more wonder in the train.
And to make better sport, as him they eyed,

And lightly with the rowels touched his side:

And left behind each gazer stupefied.

The goodly, sainted elder made the cave,
In which men cleansed from all offences are;
Such mercy there, it seems, is</p></div> </div>
