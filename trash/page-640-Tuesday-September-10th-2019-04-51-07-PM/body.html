<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When him the wary paladin espied,
He stopt his courser, not without great heed,
Lest he into the covert snare might tide,
Forewarned of this by the good hermit's rede.
Here to his horn for succour he applied,
Nor failed its wonted virtue in this need:
It smote the giant's heart with such affright,
That he turned back, and homeward fled outright.</p><blockquote><p>LIV</p></blockquote><p>Astolpho blew, still watchful of surprise,
Weening to see the engine sprung: fast flew
The giant, — as if heart as well as eyes
The thief had lost, — nor whitherward he knew:
Such is his fear, he kens not as he flies,
How is own covert mischief to eschew:
He runs into the net, which closing round,
Hampers the wretch, and drags him to the ground.</p><blockquote><p>LV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Astolpho, who beholds his bulky prey
Fall bodily,</p></div> </div>
