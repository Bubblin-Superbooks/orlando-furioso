Or nigh those hills, whence Nile's full waters spin,
Orlando had not borne a dingier skin.</p><blockquote><p>LX</p></blockquote><p>Nigh buried in their sockets are his eyes,
Spare in his visage, and as dry as bone:
Dishevelled is his hair in woeful wise,
With frightful beard his cheek is overgrown:
No sooner is he seen, than backward flies
Angelica, who, trembling sore, is flown:
She shrieking loud, all trembling and dismaid,
Betakes her to her youthful guide for aid.</p><blockquote><p>LXI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">When crazed Orlando was of her aware,
To seize the damsel he upsprang in haste;
So pleased the wretched count her visage fair,
So quickly was his mood inflamed: effaced
In him all ancient recollections are,
How she by him was whilom served and graced.
Behind her speech</p></div> </div>
