<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">long days, so broken down; with pain
The knight could but upon his feet have stood,
To fall, albeit unpushed, to ground again.
With helm on head, and with his faulchion good
Begirt, he lay reclined in plate and chain.
A pillow of his buckler had he made,
Where the white unicorn was seen pourtraid.</p><blockquote><p>XXVII</p></blockquote><p>There thinking what an injury he had done
To his lady love — how ingrate, how untrue
To her had been — not simple grief alone
O'erwhelmed him, to such height his fury grew,
He bit his hands and lips; while pouring down
His cheeks, the tears unceasing ran, and through
The passion that so wrapt his troubled sprite,
Nor Leo nor Melissa heard the knight.</p><blockquote><p>XXVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Nor therefore interrupts he his lament,
Nor checks his sighs, nor checks his trickling tears.
Young Leo halts,</p></div> </div>
