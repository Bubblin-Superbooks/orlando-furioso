Nay, the redoubted damsel hearing said
That Agramant, subdued by Charles's crew,
— His choicest warriors taken, chased, or dead —
In Arles was sheltered with his broken few,
Thither, unbidden by the monarch, sped,
Prompt to assist him with her friendly blade;
And proffered purse and person in his aid.</p><blockquote><p>VII</p></blockquote><p>As a free gift to him the martial fair
Brunello bore, nor had she done him wrong.
He, for ten days and nights, to swing in air,
Had sorely feared, from lofty gallows hung:
But seeing him unhelped by force or prayer
Of any one amid the paynim throng,
She thought foul scorn to stain her generous hands
With such base blood, and loosed the losel's bands.</p><blockquote><p>VIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
