By little and by little warmed, took fire.</p><blockquote><p>XXVII</p></blockquote><p>The shepherd dwelt, between two mountains hoar,
In goodly cabin, in the greenwood shade,
With wife and children; and, short time before,
The brent-new shed had builded in the glade.
Here of his griesly wound the youthful Moor
Was briefly healed by the Catayan maid;
But who in briefer space, a sorer smart
Than young Medoro's, suffered at her heart.</p><blockquote><p>XXVIII</p></blockquote><p>A wound far wider and which deeper lies,
Now in her heart she feels, from viewless bow;
Which from the boy's fair hair and beauteous eyes
Had the winged archer dealt: a sudden glow
She feels, and still the flames increasing rise;
Yet less she heeds her own than other's woe:
â€” Heeds not herself, and only to content
The author of her cruel ill is bent.</p><blockquote><p>XXIX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
