Wearies of welcoming that warrior true.</p><blockquote><p>LXI</p></blockquote><p>Leo, who well can play the spokesman, now
That warlike band hath ceased to clip the knight,
Tells before Charles and all that audience, how
Rogero's daring, how Rogero's might,
— Albeit to his good squadron's scathe and woe —
Which at Belgrade he witnessed in that fight,
So moved him that they overweighed all harms
Inflicted on him by the warrior's arms.</p><blockquote><p>LXII</p></blockquote><p>So that to her Rogero being brought,
Who would all havoc of the youth have made,
He setting all his family at nought,
Had out of durance vile the knight conveyed;
And how Rogero, that the rescue wrought
By Leo might be worthily repaid,
Did that high courtesy; which can by none,
That ever were or e'er will be, outdone;</p><blockquote><p>LXIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
