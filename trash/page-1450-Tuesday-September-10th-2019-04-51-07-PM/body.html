With labour sore, this tangle to undo;
Nor only cannot they persuade the twain
In peace and concord to unite anew,
But cannot make the valiant Child refrain
From claiming Hector's buckler as his due;
Nor yet Gradasso move the sword to lend,
'Till this, or till that, quarrel have an end.</p><blockquote><p>XX</p></blockquote><p>Rogero brooks not that in other fight
His shield be braced, nor will Gradasso bear
That save against himself the Tartar knight
Should wield the sword Orlando used to wear
"See we, in fine, on whom the chance will light

And choose him that of her shall chosen be.</p><blockquote><p>XXI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"And â€” would ye do what most would me</p></div> </div>
