<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">signal made,
Be without noise by me within conveyed.</p><blockquote><p>XLVII</p></blockquote><p>" `Let it not irk thee to await the peer
Within my chamber, where no light will be;
Till I shall make him doff his warlike gear,
And, almost naked, yield him up to thee.'
So did his wife into that quicksand steer
Her hapless husband (it appears to me)
If wife she rightly could be called; more fell
And cruel than a fury sprung from hell.</p><blockquote><p>XLVIII</p></blockquote><p>"She drew my brother forth, that guilty night,
With his good arms in hand, and him again
Secreted in the chamber without light,
Till thither came the wretched castellain.
As it was ordered, all fell out aright,
For seldom ill design is schemed in vain.
So fell Argaeus by Philander's sword,
Who for Morando took the castle's lord.</p><blockquote><p>XLIX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
