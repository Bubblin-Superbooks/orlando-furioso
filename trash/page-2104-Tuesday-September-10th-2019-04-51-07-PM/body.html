Is that, when once thou didst this greenwood thread,
Thou from a rustic's fury rescuedst me,
By whose ill handling was I sore bested.
But for thine aid, I should not have got free,
Without a broken spine or battered head:
With body crooked and crushed I should have lain,
Albeit I could not by his arm be slain.</p><blockquote><p>CII</p></blockquote><p>" `Because thou hast to know upon the day
We sprang from earth with scales of dragon dight,
— Subject to us at other times — to obey
The heavens refuse; and we are void of might:
At other seasons, at our simple say
The circling sun stands still, and dims its light:
Fixt earth is moved, and in a circle wheels:
Ice at our word takes fire, and fire congeals.</p><blockquote><p>CIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
