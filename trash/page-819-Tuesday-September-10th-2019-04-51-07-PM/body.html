Had pressed Orlando sore in martial game,
And him who had Mount Alban in command;
And ever, night and day, the armed dame
Scowered, here and there, by hill and plain, the land;
Hoping with errant cavalier to meet,
And win immortal fame by glorious feat.</p><blockquote><p>C</p></blockquote><p>When Sansonnetto and the English knight

Who seem two valiant warriors in her sight,
As of large bone, and nerved for doughty deed,
On them she fain would prove her martial might,
And to defy the pair has moved her steed.
When, eyeing the two warriors, now more near,
Marphisa recognized the duke and peer.</p><blockquote><p>CI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">His pleasing ways she did in mind retrace,
When arms in far Catay with her he bore
