By longer sojourn here, a remedy,

Nor would have been an hour away from thee:

I, who could do no better, fixed to go.</p><blockquote><p>LX</p></blockquote><p>" `Into the middle of a wood profound
By chance I from the beaten pathway strayed:
Where near me plaintive cries I hear resound,
As of a woman who intreated aid.
To a lake of crystal I pursue the sound,
And, there, amid the waves, a naked maid
Caught on the fish-hook of a Faun, survey,
Who would devour alive his helpless prey.</p><blockquote><p>LXI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">" <code>Upon the losel, sword in hand, I ran,
And, for I could not aid in other wise,
Bereft of life that evil</p></div> </div>
