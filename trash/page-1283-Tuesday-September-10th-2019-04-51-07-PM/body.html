<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">could not singly such an ill repair.</p><blockquote><p>CXI</p></blockquote><p>As peasant, when a river saps its mounds,
And seeking vent the oozing waters drop,
Hastening to shut the stream within its bounds,
And save his pastures and expected crop,
Dams right and left; yet him the stream confounds:
For, if he here the sinking ruin prop,
There he beholds the rotten dyke give out,
And from thick seams the restless water spout,</p><blockquote><p>CXII</p></blockquote><p>So, while the Tartar and Rogero rage,
And Rodomont, in hurly-burly fray,
For each of these would fiercest battle wage,
And would outgo his fears in that assay,
Marphisa seeks their fury to assuage,
And strives, and time and trouble throws away;
For as she makes one knight from strife retire,
She sees the others re-engage with ire.</p><blockquote><p>CXIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
