He made demand; and in the stranger knew
Dudon, the Danish Ogier's valiant son:
He from Rogero claimed an equal due,
And from the Child as courteous answer won.
— Their names on either side announced — the foes
A bold defiance speak, and come to blows.</p><blockquote><p>LXXIX</p></blockquote><p>Bold Dudon had with him that iron mace,
Which won him deathless fame in many a fight:
Wherewith he proved him fully of the race
Of that good Danish warrior, famed for might.
That best of faulchions, which through iron case
Of cuirass or of casque was wont to bite,
Youthful Rogero from the scabbard snatched,
And with the martial Dane his valour matched.</p><blockquote><p>LXXX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">But for the gentle youth was ever willed
