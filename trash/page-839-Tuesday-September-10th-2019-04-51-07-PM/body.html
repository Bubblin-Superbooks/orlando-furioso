With such dread flashes, and loud peals of thunder,
As Heaven, to swallow all in fire, would sunder.</p><blockquote><p>CXLII</p></blockquote><p>The clouds their gloomy veil above them strain,
Nor suffer sun or star to cheer the view.
Above the welkin roared, beneath the main;
On every side the wind and tempest grew;
Which, with sharp piercing cold and blinding rain,
Afflicted sore the miserable crew.
While aye descending night, with deeper shade,
The vext and fearful billows overlayed.</p><blockquote><p>CXLIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The sailors, in this war of wind and flood,
Were prompt to manifest their vaunted art.
One blowing through the shrilling whistle stood,
And with the signal taught the rest their part.
One clears the best bower anchor: one is good
To lower, this other to hawl home</p></div> </div>
