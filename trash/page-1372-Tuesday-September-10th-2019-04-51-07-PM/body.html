And, what he least believed, within espied;
For he beneath the quilt, his consort true
And chaste, saw sleeping at a stripling's side.

To draw his sword, and both of life bereave;
But love, which spite himself, he entertained
For that ungrateful woman, him restrained.</p><blockquote><p>XXIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"You see if like a vassal he obeyed
