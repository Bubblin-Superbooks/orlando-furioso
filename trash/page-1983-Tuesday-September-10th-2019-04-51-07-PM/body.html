Why persecutest thou my faithful seed?"
As whilom said the Saviour to Saint Paul,
When (blessed stroke! he smote him from his steed. )</p><p>"Thou thought'st to pass the sea, nor pay withal;
Thought'st to defraud the pilot of his meed.
Thou seest that God has arms to reach and smite,
When farthest off thou deem'st that God of might."</p><blockquote><p>LIV</p></blockquote><p>And he, that holiest anchoret, pursued,
To whom the night foregoing God did send
A vision, as he slumbered, and foreshewed
How, thither by his aid the Child should wend;
Wherein his past and future life, reviewed,
Were seen, as well as his unhappy end;
And sons, and grandsons, and his every heir,
Fully revealed to that good hermit were.</p><blockquote><p>LV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
