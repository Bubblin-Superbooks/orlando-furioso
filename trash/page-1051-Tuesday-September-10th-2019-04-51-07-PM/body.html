In neighboring wood, and bade his followers bear
Two of them hither, destined for that shock:
Such truncheons to withstand, well needed-were
A shield and cuirass of the diamond rock.
One he had made them give his foe, and one

By fiends, had little from the stroke to fear:

Of whose rare virtues I whilere have said.</p><blockquote><p>LXVIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I have already said, the enchanted light
