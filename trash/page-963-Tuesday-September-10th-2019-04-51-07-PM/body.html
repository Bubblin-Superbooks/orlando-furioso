The Greek Morea; rounding Sicily,

Gives thanks to God at having passed the sea
Without more harm, and makes the well-known shore.

For France, and that same day his pinnace climb;
Thence wafted to Marseilles in little time.</p><blockquote><p>CII</p></blockquote><p>There was not Bradamant, who used to sway
