Twas sign of evil and ungenerous will,
And corresponded not with chivalry,
That he a woman should desire to kill;
Yet if the knight persists, he will not flee â€”
But bids him well consider first how ill

Should wish to dip his hand in woman's blood.</p><blockquote><p>IX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">This and yet more he vainly says; nor stand
They idle long; from word they pass to deed;
And having compassed on the level land
Enough of ground, encounter on the mead.
Not fired in some rejoicing, from the hand
Discharged, so fast the whistling rockets speed,
As the two coursers bear the cavaliers
To hurtle</p></div> </div>
