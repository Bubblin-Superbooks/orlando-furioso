His back, the fierce Marphisa had made fast,
And to Drusilla's maid the wretch consigned,
Well pleased that such a care on her was cast.
To burn the town 'twas afterwards designed,
Save it repented of its errors past,
Repealed the statute Marganor had made,
And a new law, imposed by her, obeyed.</p><blockquote><p>CIV</p></blockquote><p>Such end to compass is no hard assay;
For, besides fearing lest Marphisa yearn
To execute more vengeance, — lest she say,
— She one and all will slaughter and will burn, —
The townsmen all were advised to the sway
And cruel statute of that tyrant stern;
But did, as others mostly do, that best
Obey the master whom they most detest.</p><blockquote><p>CV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
