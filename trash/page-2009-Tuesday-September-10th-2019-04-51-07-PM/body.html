<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">forehead with such grievous blow,
That all believed it to its rest was gone;
â€” Inflamed them with such fury, for the foe
In rampart, fosse, or wall, defence was none,
Who, one and all, within their works lay dead,
Nor wight was left the woeful news to spread.</p><blockquote><p>IV</p></blockquote><p>Seeing thy fall caused thine such mighty pain,
They were to fury moved; hadst thou, my lord,
Maintained thy footing, haply might thy train
Have with less licence plied the murderous sword.
Enough for thee thy Bastia to regain!
In fewer hours replaced beneath thy ward,
Then Cordova's and fierce Granada's band
Took days erewhile, to wrest it from thy hand.</p><blockquote><p>V</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Haply Heaven's vengeance ordered what befel,
And in that case thy wound so hindered thee
To the end, the cruel outrage, foul and fell,
Done by that band before,</p></div> </div>
