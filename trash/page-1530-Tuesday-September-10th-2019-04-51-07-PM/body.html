O'erturning all who cross his fierce career,
He leaves afflicted and in piteous plight
The broken bands of Afric and of France.
All, food alike for his wide-wasting lance.</p><blockquote><p>XCIV</p></blockquote><p>He seeks the paladin, now here now there,
Echoing his name as loud as he can shout;
And thitherward inclines his courser, where
The bodies are most thickly strown about.
At length encounter, sword to sword, the pair,
For broken are alike their lances stout;
Which shivering in their hands, had flown upright.
And smote the starry chariot of the Night.</p><blockquote><p>XCV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">When King Gradasso recognized the foe,
Not by the blazoned bearing of his shield,
But by Baiardo â€” by that horrid blow,
Which made him seem sole champion of the field,
He to reproach the knight was nothing</p></div> </div>
