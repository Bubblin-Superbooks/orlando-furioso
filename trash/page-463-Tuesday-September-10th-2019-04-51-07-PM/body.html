To the Irish monarch, who to serve her swore:
Although this needed not; since he was bent
More than behoved, her wishes to content:</p><blockquote><p>LXXIX</p></blockquote><p>So levied in few days his warlike band,
And (league with England's kind and Scotland's made)
In Holland and in Friesland left no land
To the false duke, so rapid was the raid.
And to rebel against that lord's command
His Zealand stirred; nor he the war delayed,
Until by him Bireno's blood was spilt:
A punishment that ill atoned his guilt.</p><blockquote><p>LXXX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Oberto takes to wife Olympia fair,
And her of countess makes a puissant queen.
But be the Paladin again our care,
Who furrows , night and day, the billows green,
And strikes his sails in the same harbour, where
They to the wind erewhile unfurled had been
