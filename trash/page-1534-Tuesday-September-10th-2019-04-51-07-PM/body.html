Is of that history informed aright;
And now, from point to point, relates anew
(Nor more nor less rehearsed the magic sleight. )</p><p>When thus Rinaldo: "What I warrant true
By witness, I with arms in single fight,
For better proof, will vouch upon thy crest,
Both now and ever, as it likes thee best."</p><blockquote><p>CIII</p></blockquote><p>The king of Sericane, as loath to leave

Though doubtful how that tale he should receive,
Takes in good part the bold Rinaldo's speech.

But on the morn ensuing, and, fast by
A neighbouring fountain, will the question try.</p><blockquote><p>CIV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
