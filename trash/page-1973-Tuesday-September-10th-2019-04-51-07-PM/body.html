Than a dim surcoat to the field to take.
By gentle Flordelice for that dark array,
Was wrought the fairest facing she could make.
With costly jewels was the border sown;
Sable the vest, and of one piece alone.</p><blockquote><p>XXXII</p></blockquote><p>With her own hand the lady wrought that vest,
Becoming well the finest plate and chain,
Wherein the valiant warrior should be drest,
And cloak his courser's croup and chest and mane:
But, from that day when she herself addrest
Unto this task, till ended was her pain,
She showed no sign of gladness; nor this while,
Nor after, was she ever seen to smile.</p><blockquote><p>XXXIII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The heartfelt fear, the torment evermore
Of losing Brandimart the dame pursued.

Engaged in fierce and fearful fight had viewed;
Nor ever suchlike terror</p></div> </div>
