"Nor think to make it thine without a fight:
If so thou tookest Hector's arms of pride,
By theft thou hadst them, rather than by right."
Without more parley spurred upon each side.
Well matched in soul and valour, either knight.
Already echoed are a thousand blows;
Nor yet well entered are the encountering foes.</p><blockquote><p>LXI</p></blockquote><p>In scaping Durindane, a flame in show
(He shifts so quickly is the Scottish lord. )</p><p>He leaps about his courser like a doe,
Where'er the road best footing does afford.
And well it is that he should not forego
An inch of vantage; who, if once that sword
Smite him, will join the enamoured ghosts, which rove
Amid the mazes of the myrtle grove.</p><blockquote><p>LXII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">As the swift-footed dog, who does espy
