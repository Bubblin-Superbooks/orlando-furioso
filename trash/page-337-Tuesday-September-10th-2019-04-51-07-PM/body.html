Orlando, hearing this, no more delayed,
But issued from the bark with hurried pace,
And, in all kind and courteous usage bred,
His way directed where the ancient led.</p><blockquote><p>XXI</p></blockquote><p>With him did Roland to the city go,
And at the bottom of a palace-stair,
Conducted by that elder, full of woe

And sable cloth, with which (a mournful show)
Chamber, and hall, and gallery, furnished were;
Who, after honourable welcome paid,
Seated the paladin, and sadly said:</p><blockquote><p>XXII</p></blockquote><p>"The daughter of the Count of Holland," (cried
The Lady "know in me, Sir cavalier. )</p><p>Though not his only offspring (for beside
Myself two brothers were to him so dear, )</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">That, for whatever favour I applied,
I never met</p></div> </div>
