And how she made Medoro, India's king;
Perchance some voice in happier verse may sing.</p><blockquote><p>XVII</p></blockquote><p>To say so many things I am intent,
I mean not to pursue the cavalier.
To Mandricardo my fair argument
It now behoves me, in his turn, to veer
He happily enjoyed, his rival spent,
The beauty, left in Europe without peer,
Since fair Angelica from hence had wended,
And virtuous Isabel to heaven ascended.</p><blockquote><p>XVIII</p></blockquote><p>King Mandricardo, proud that in his right
His lady had adjudged the amorous suit,
Enjoys not her award with full delight;
Since others with him other points dispute.
By young Rogero claimed, that eagle white
Of one disastrous quarrel is the root;
Another moves the king of Sericana
Against the Tartar king, for Durindana.</p><blockquote><p>XIX</p></blockquote></div> </div>
