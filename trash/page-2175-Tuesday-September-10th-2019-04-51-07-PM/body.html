Shall be for Aymon no unworthy son.</p><blockquote><p>LIII</p></blockquote><p>"But if he give without delay, as said,
His daughter to the son of Constantine,
If to that promise no regard be paid,
Which good Rinaldo and the paladine,
His cousin, erst before the hermit made,
The Marquis Olivier and King Sobrine,
What shall I do?  such grievous wrong shall I
Endure, or, rather than endure it, die?</p><blockquote><p>LIV</p></blockquote><p>"What shall I do?  her father then pursue,
On whom for vengeance this grave outrage cries?
I heed not that the deed is hard to do,
Or if the attempt in me is weak or wise: â€”
But presuppose that, with his kindred crew
Slain by my hand that unjust elder dies;
This will in nothing further my content;
Nay it will wholly frustrate my intent.</p><blockquote><p>LV</p></blockquote></div> </div>
