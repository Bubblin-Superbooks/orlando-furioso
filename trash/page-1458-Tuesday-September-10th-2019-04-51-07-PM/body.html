At least for my life's sake esteem yours dear;
For one without the other shall not die.
With you to die excites in me no fear;
With you, prepared for life or death am I:
Yet would I fain not die so ill content,
As I should die if you before me went."</p><blockquote><p>XXXVII</p></blockquote><p>Accompanying words with tears and sighs,
In such, or such like speech she him did pray,
Throughout that livelong night, in piteous wise,
Hoping her lover's anger to allay;
And Mandricardo, sucking from her eyes
Those sweet tears, glittering in their humid ray,
And that sweet moan, from lips more deeply dyed
Than crimson rose, himself in tears, replied.</p><blockquote><p>XXXVIII</p></blockquote><p>"Alack!  my dearest life!  take thou no dread,
Alack!  for love of Heaven!  of thing so light:
