But Malagigi and Vivian, in pursuit,
Follow, and from afar that maid salute;</p><blockquote><p>CXXXVII</p></blockquote><p>And so Sir Richardet as well: but low
On earth lies Aldigier, and there must rest.
The two first champions towards Paris go,
And the two others next pursue that quest.
In other canto, Sir, I hope to show
Of wondrous and of superhuman gest,
Wrought to the damage of the Christian king,
By those two couples of whose worth I sing.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
