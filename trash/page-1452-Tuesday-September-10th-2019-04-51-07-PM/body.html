Should undertake for both in listed mead.
Thus in two scrolls, inscribed in the same way,
Their names are writ as destined to succeed.

A billet from the vase, and if befel,
Thereon Rogero's name the assistants knew;
— Gradasso's left behind — I cannot tell
How joyed renowned Rogero at the view,
And can as little say what sorrow fell
Upon Gradasso, on the other side;
But he parforce his fortune must abide.</p><blockquote><p>XXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Gradasso every thought and every deed

That in the strife his champion may succeed;
And teaches every sleight he has assaid:
