Nor weary me, by forcing me to meet
Champions like thee, untried in martial feat."</p><blockquote><p>LXXIII</p></blockquote><p>They on the walls, that know not who the peer
That in the joust so well maintains his seat,
Name many a warrior, famous in career,
That often make them shake in fiercest heat.
Brandimart many deem the cavalier;
More guesses in renowned Rinaldo meet;
Many would deem Orlando was the knight,
But that they knew his pitiable plight.</p><blockquote><p>LXXIV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The third encounter craved Lanfusa's son,
And cried, "Not that I better hope to fare,
But that to warriors who this course have run,
My fall may furnish an excuse more fair."
Next, with all arms that martial jousters don,
Clothed him, and of a hundred steeds that were
Ready for service, kept in lordly stall,
For speed</p></div> </div>
