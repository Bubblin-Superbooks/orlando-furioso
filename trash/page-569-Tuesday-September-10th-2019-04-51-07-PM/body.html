When lo! he saw a mead, o'ertopt with shade,
Where a deep river wound about the field,
With narrow space between the turns it made,

With such a troop, and to what end, the shore?

Moved by his lordly air, and arms he wore,
Glittering with gold and jewels, â€” costly gear,
Which showed him an illustrious cavalier.</p><blockquote><p>XL</p></blockquote><p>"In charge" (he said "we of the daughter go )</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Of him our king, who fills Granada's</p></div> </div>
