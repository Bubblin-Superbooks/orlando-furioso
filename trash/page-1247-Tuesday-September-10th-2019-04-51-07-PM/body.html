And claim withal, as to its keeping given,
The sacred keys which open Hell and Heaven.</p><blockquote><p>XXXIV</p></blockquote><p>Approaching next, is seen a cavalier,
His temples circled with imperial bay;
Three youths with him in company appear,
With golden lilies wrought in their array:

Some on their skirt, some written overhead.</p><blockquote><p>XXXV</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Of those who so against Beast advance,

The emperor Charles the fifth is signified:
