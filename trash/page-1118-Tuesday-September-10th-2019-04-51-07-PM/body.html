Known to Orlando like the Latin tongue,

And injury, and shame, had saved his head,
What time he roved the Saracens among.
But let him boast not of its former boot,
O'erbalanced by the present bitter fruit.</p><blockquote><p>CXI</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Three times, and four, and six, the lines imprest
