And sorely threatened the departed knight,
By him so foul a fault should be repented,
Save he, returning home, his wrath prevented.</p><blockquote><p>LXXXVIII</p></blockquote><p>Nor would Orlando's faithful Brandimart,
Who loved him as himself, behind him stay;
Whether to bring him back he in his heart
Hoped, or of him ill brooked injurious say:
And scarce, in his impatience to depart,
Till fall of eve his sally would delay.
Lest she should hinder his design, of this
He nought imparted to his Flordelis:</p><blockquote><p>LXXXIX</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">To him this was a lady passing dear,
And from whose side he unwont to stray;
Endowed with manners, grace, and beauteous cheer,
Wisdom and wit: if now he went away
And took no leave, it was because the peer
Hoped to revisit her that very day.
But that befel him</p></div> </div>
