Without expense to us, in less than one
Short month, the kingdom by my father lost
Restored; and, to repair the mischief done,
(Beside spoil given he conquered with his host, )</p><p>— Taxing or taking what his arms had won —
Armenia and Cappadocia which confine;
And scowered Hyrcania to the distant brine.</p><blockquote><p>XXXVII</p></blockquote><p>"Him not to greet with triumphs, but to slay,
Returning from that warfare, we intend;
But, fearing failure, our design delay
In that we find too many him befriend.
Feeding him aye with hope from day to day,
I for the Thracian warrior love pretend:
But first declare my will that he oppose
And prove his valour on our other foes;</p><blockquote><p>XXXVIII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
