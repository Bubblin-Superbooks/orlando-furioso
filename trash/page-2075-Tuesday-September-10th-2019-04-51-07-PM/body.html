Like scarlet; nor would listen to my say;
But seeing those bright jewels flash like flame,
Her stubborn heart was softened, and gave way;
And in brief speech and feeble said the dame

She with my wishes, said, she would comply,
If sure to be unseen of watchful eye.</p><blockquote><p>XXXIX</p></blockquote><p>"Me my wife's words like poisoned weapon thrill,
And pierce my suffering spirit through and through:
Through bones and veins there went a deadly chill;
My tongue clave to my throat: The witch withdrew
With that the magic mantle, and at will
Transformed me to mine ancient shape anew.

Taken by me in such notorious shame!</p><blockquote><p>XL</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Of deadly hue we both of us remain;
