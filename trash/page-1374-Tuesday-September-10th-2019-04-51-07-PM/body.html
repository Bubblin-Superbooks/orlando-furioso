The ground that melancholy stripling eyed.

Inflamed and opened, which he sought to close.

His appetite is gone, with his repose,
Ne'er to return; and (whilom of such fame)
His lovely visage seems no more the same.</p><blockquote><p>XXVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"His eye-balls seem deep-buried in his head,
