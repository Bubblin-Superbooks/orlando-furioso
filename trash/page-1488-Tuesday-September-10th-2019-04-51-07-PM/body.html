So that the hope of guerdon does not cease.
For worthy service in the end is paid,
Albeit its wages should be long delaid.</p><blockquote><p>IV</p></blockquote><p>Scorn, and repulse, and finally each pain
Of suffering love, his every martyrdom,
Through recollection, make us entertain
Delights with greater rapture, when they come.
But if weak mind be poisoned by that bane,
That filthy pest, conceived in Stygian home,
Though joy ensue, with all its festive pleasures,
The wretched lover ill his comfort measures.</p><blockquote><p>V</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">This is that cruel and envenomed wound
Where neither salve nor portion soothes the smart;
Nor figure made by witch, nor murmured sound;
Nor star benign observed in friendly part;
Nor aught beside by Zoroaster found,
Inventor as he was of magic art.
