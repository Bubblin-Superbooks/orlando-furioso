<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">many days since with intent
Of putting thee to death from court I went.</p><blockquote><p>XXXV</p></blockquote><p>"Because I would not see my promised bride
Borne off by thee; in that Duke Aymon's love
And favour was engaged upon thy side.
But, for man purposes, and God above
Disposes, thy great courtesy, well tried
In a sore need, my fixt resolve did move.
Nor only I renounced the hate I bore,
But purposed to be thine for evermore.</p><blockquote><p>XXXVI</p></blockquote><p>"What time I as Rogero was unknown,
Thou madest suit I would obtain for thee
The Lady Bradamant; which was all one
As to demand my heart and soul from me.
Whether thy wish I rather than mine own
Sought to content, thou hast been made to see.
Thine is the lady; her in peace possess;
Far more than mine I prize thy happiness.</p><blockquote><p>XXXVII</p></blockquote></div> </div>
