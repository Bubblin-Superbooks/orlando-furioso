Nor thought he of retreat, albeit was none

In fury shreds and shears the valiant knight.
Now springs on these, now those, with vigorous bound;
And these and those betake themselves to flight.

Too late to save him deem all human aid.</p><blockquote><p>XXVII</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Throughout the squadrons a deep rumour flew,
