No gain, no glory served you as a guide,
A common debt enjoins you mutual aid,
Militant here upon one Church's side.
Moreover, let not any be afraid,
Our broken foemen will the assault abide;
Who seem to me ill-taught in warlike art,
A feeble rabble without arms or heart."</p><blockquote><p>XXXIX</p></blockquote><p>Such reasons, and yet better for, that need
Might good Rinaldo in his speech infer;
And with quick phrase and voice, to valiant deed
The high-minded barons and bold army stir;
And this was but to goad a willing steed
(As the old proverb says who lacks no spur. )</p><p>He moved the squadrons, having closed his speech,
Softly, beneath their separate banners, each.</p><blockquote><p>XL</p></blockquote></div> </div>
