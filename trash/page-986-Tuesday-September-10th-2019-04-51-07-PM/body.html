In its secure, inextricable, fold;
Nor holy Faith, it seems, except in white
Was mantled over in the days of old;

Remote from town and hamlet, as if plighted
Amid a crowd of witnesses, before

Nor needs the solemn sanction of an oath:
It is sufficient that we pledge our troth.</p><blockquote><p>III</p></blockquote><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And this maintains as it maintained should be,
In each emprize the Scottish cavalier,
And gives good proof of his fidelity,
Quitting his road with that old</p></div> </div>
