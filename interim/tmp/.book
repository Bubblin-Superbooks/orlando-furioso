It begins more or less at the point where Boiardo left\nit.</p><p>This is a brief synopsis of Boiardo's work, omitting most of the\nnumerous digressions and incidental episodes associated with\nthese events:</p><p>To the court of King Charlemagne comes Angelica (daughter to the\nking of Cathay, or India and her brother Argalia.  Angelica is )</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">the most beautiful woman any of the Peers have ever</p>",
  "page-10": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">seen, and all\nwant her.  However, in order to take her as wife they must first\ndefeat Argalia in combat.  The two most stricken by her are\nOrlando and Ranaldo (\"Rinaldo\" in Rose).</p><p>When Argalia falls to the heathen knight Ferrau, Angelica flees\n--- with Orlando and Ranaldo in hot pursuit.  Along the way, both\nAngelica and Ranaldo drink magic waters — Angelica is filled\nwith a burning love for Ranaldo, but Ranaldo is now indifferent.</p><p>Eventually, Orlando and Ranaldo arrive at Angelica's castle.\nOthers also gather at Angelica's castle, including Agricane, King\nof Tartary; Sacripant, King of Circassia; Agramante, King of\nAfrica and Marfisa (\"Marphisa\" in Rose), an Asian warrior-Queen.\nExcept for Orlando and Ranaldo, all are heathen.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Meanwhile, France is threatened by heathen invaders.  Led by King\nGradasso of Sericana (whose principal reason for going to war is\nto obtain Orlando's</p>",
  "page-11": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sword, Durindana and King Rodomonte of )</p><p>Sarzia, a Holy War between Pagans and Christians ensues.</p><p>Ranaldo leaves Angelica's castle, and Angelica and a very\nlove-sick (but very chaste and proper Orlando, set out for )</p><p>France in search of him.  Again the same waters as before are\ndrunk from, but this time in reverse — Ranaldo now burns for\nAngelica, but Angelica is now indifferent.  Ranaldo and Orlando\nnow begin to fight over her, but King Charlemagne (fearing the\nconsequences if his two best knights kill each other in combat)\nintervenes and promises Angelica to whichever of the two fights\nthe best against the heathen; he leaves her in the care of Duke\nNamus.  Orlando and Ranaldo arrive in Paris just in time to\nrepulse an attack by Agramante.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Namus' camp is overrun by the heathen.  Angelica</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">escapes, with\nRanaldo in pursuit.  Also in pursuit is Ferrau, who (because he\nhad defeated Argalia considers Angelica his.  It is at this )</p><p>point that the poem breaks off.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">While the Orlando-Ranaldo-Angelica triangle is going on, the\nstories of other knights and their loves are mixed in.  Most\nimportant of these is that of the female knight Bradamante\n(sister of Ranaldo), who falls in love with a very noble heathen\nknight named Ruggiero (\"Rogero\" in Rose).  Ruggiero, who is said\nto be a descendent of Alexander the Great and Hector, also falls\nin love with Bradamante, but because they are fighting on\nopposite sides it is felt that their love is hopeless.\nNevertheless, it is prophecised that they shall wed and found the\nfamous Este line, who shall rise to become one of the major\nfamilies of Medieval and Renaissance Italy (it is worth noting\nthat the Estes where the patrons of both Boiardo and Ariosto).\n</p>",
  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Opposed to this prophecy is Atlantes, an African wizard who seeks\nto derail fate and keep Ruggiero from becoming a Christian.  By\nthe end of the poem, Ruggiero is imprisoned in Atlantes' castle.\nHowever, Bradamante (who has decided to follow her heart is in )</p><p>pursuit of her love, and is not too far away.  It is the\nBradamante-Ruggiero story that eventually takes center stage in\nAriosto's work.</p><p>Other characters of importance: Astolfo, a Peer and friend of\nOrlando, who is kidnaped by the evil witch Morgana and her sister\nAlcina; Mandricardo, a fierce but hot-headed heathen; and a young\nknight named Brandimarte, who falls in love with (and wins the\nheart of the beautiful Fiordelisa (\"Flordelice\" in Rose).
