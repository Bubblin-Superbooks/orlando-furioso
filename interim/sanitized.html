<body> <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>This work is a continuation of the &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot; of Matteo
Maria Boiardo, which was left unfinished upon the author&#39;s death
in 1494.  It begins more or less at the point where Boiardo left
it.</p>
<p>This is a brief synopsis of Boiardo&#39;s work, omitting most of the
numerous digressions and incidental episodes associated with
these events:</p>
<p>To the court of King Charlemagne comes Angelica (daughter to the
king of Cathay, or India and her brother Argalia.  Angelica is ) </p>
<p>the most beautiful woman any of the Peers have ever seen, and all
want her.  However, in order to take her as wife they must first
defeat Argalia in combat.  The two most stricken by her are
Orlando and Ranaldo (&quot;Rinaldo&quot; in Rose).</p>
<p>When Argalia falls to the heathen knight Ferrau, Angelica flees
--- with Orlando and Ranaldo in hot pursuit.  Along the way, both
Angelica and Ranaldo drink magic waters — Angelica is filled
with a burning love for Ranaldo, but Ranaldo is now indifferent.</p>
<p>Eventually, Orlando and Ranaldo arrive at Angelica&#39;s castle.
Others also gather at Angelica&#39;s castle, including Agricane, King
of Tartary; Sacripant, King of Circassia; Agramante, King of
Africa and Marfisa (&quot;Marphisa&quot; in Rose), an Asian warrior-Queen.
Except for Orlando and Ranaldo, all are heathen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, France is threatened by heathen invaders.  Led by King
Gradasso of Sericana (whose principal reason for going to war is
to obtain Orlando&#39;s sword, Durindana and King Rodomonte of ) </p>
<p>Sarzia, a Holy War between Pagans and Christians ensues.</p>
<p>Ranaldo leaves Angelica&#39;s castle, and Angelica and a very
love-sick (but very chaste and proper Orlando, set out for ) </p>
<p>France in search of him.  Again the same waters as before are
drunk from, but this time in reverse — Ranaldo now burns for
Angelica, but Angelica is now indifferent.  Ranaldo and Orlando
now begin to fight over her, but King Charlemagne (fearing the
consequences if his two best knights kill each other in combat)
intervenes and promises Angelica to whichever of the two fights
the best against the heathen; he leaves her in the care of Duke
Namus.  Orlando and Ranaldo arrive in Paris just in time to
repulse an attack by Agramante.</p>
<p>Namus&#39; camp is overrun by the heathen.  Angelica escapes, with
Ranaldo in pursuit.  Also in pursuit is Ferrau, who (because he
had defeated Argalia considers Angelica his.  It is at this ) </p>
<p>point that the poem breaks off.</p>
<p>While the Orlando-Ranaldo-Angelica triangle is going on, the
stories of other knights and their loves are mixed in.  Most
important of these is that of the female knight Bradamante
(sister of Ranaldo), who falls in love with a very noble heathen
knight named Ruggiero (&quot;Rogero&quot; in Rose).  Ruggiero, who is said
to be a descendent of Alexander the Great and Hector, also falls
in love with Bradamante, but because they are fighting on
opposite sides it is felt that their love is hopeless.
Nevertheless, it is prophecised that they shall wed and found the
famous Este line, who shall rise to become one of the major
families of Medieval and Renaissance Italy (it is worth noting
that the Estes where the patrons of both Boiardo and Ariosto).
Opposed to this prophecy is Atlantes, an African wizard who seeks
to derail fate and keep Ruggiero from becoming a Christian.  By
the end of the poem, Ruggiero is imprisoned in Atlantes&#39; castle.
However, Bradamante (who has decided to follow her heart is in ) </p>
<p>pursuit of her love, and is not too far away.  It is the
Bradamante-Ruggiero story that eventually takes center stage in
Ariosto&#39;s work.</p>
<p>Other characters of importance: Astolfo, a Peer and friend of
Orlando, who is kidnaped by the evil witch Morgana and her sister
Alcina; Mandricardo, a fierce but hot-headed heathen; and a young
knight named Brandimarte, who falls in love with (and wins the
heart of the beautiful Fiordelisa (&quot;Flordelice&quot; in Rose).  All ) </p>
<p>play major or semi-major roles in the events of Ariosto&#39;s poem.</p>

<h4>Canto 1</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>ARGUMENT</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Angelica, whom pressing danger frights,
Flies in disorder through the greenwood shade.
Rinaldo&#39;s horse escapes: he, following, fights
Ferrau, the Spaniard, in a forest glade.
A second oath the haughty paynim plights,
And keeps it better than the first he made.
King Sacripant regains his long-lost treasure;
But good Rinaldo mars his promised pleasure.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>I</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>OF LOVES and LADIES, KNIGHTS and ARMS, I sing,
Of COURTESIES, and many a DARING FEAT;
And from those ancient days my story bring,
When Moors from Afric passed in hostile fleet,
And ravaged France, with Agramant their king,
Flushed with his youthful rage and furious heat,
Who on king Charles&#39;, the Roman emperor&#39;s head
Had vowed due vengeance for Troyano dead.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>II</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>In the same strain of Roland will I tell
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme,
On whom strange madness and rank fury fell,
A man esteemed so wise in former time;
If she, who to like cruel pass has well
Nigh brought my feeble wit which fain would climb
And hourly wastes my sense, concede me skill
And strength my daring promise to fulfil.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>III</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Good seed of Hercules, give ear and deign,
Thou that this age&#39;s grace and splendour art,
Hippolitus, to smile upon his pain
Who tenders what he has with humble heart.
For though all hope to quit the score were vain,
My pen and pages may pay the debt in part;
Then, with no jealous eye my offering scan,
Nor scorn my gifts who give thee all I can.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And me, amid the worthiest shalt thou hear,
Whom I with fitting praise prepare to grace,
Record the good Rogero, valiant peer,
The ancient root of thine illustrious race.
Of him, if thou wilt lend a willing ear,
The worth and warlike feats I shall retrace;
So thou thy graver cares some little time
Postponing, lend thy leisure to my rhyme.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>V</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Roland, who long the lady of Catay,
Angelica, had loved, and with his brand
Raised countless trophies to that damsel gay,
In India, Median, and Tartarian land,
Westward with her had measured back his way;
Where, nigh the Pyrenees, with many a band
Of Germany and France, King Charlemagne
Had camped his faithful host upon the plain.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To make King Agramant, for penance, smite
His cheek, and rash Marsilius rue the hour;
This, when all trained with lance and sword to fight,
He led from Africa to swell his power;
That other when he pushed, in fell despite,
Against the realm of France Spain&#39;s martial flower.
&#39;Twas thus Orlando came where Charles was tented
In evil hour, and soon the deed repented.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>For here was seized his dame of peerless charms,
(How often human judgment wanders wide)!
Whom in long warfare he had kept from harms,
From western climes to eastern shores her guide
In his own land, &#39;mid friends and kindred arms,
Now without contest severed from his side.
Fearing the mischief kindled by her eyes,
From him the prudent emperor reft the prize.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>For bold Orlando and his cousin, free
Rinaldo, late contended for the maid,
Enamored of that beauty rare; since she
Alike the glowing breast of either swayed.
But Charles, who little liked such rivalry,
And drew an omen thence of feebler aid,
To abate the cause of quarrel, seized the fair,
And placed her in Bavarian Namus&#39; care.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Vowing with her the warrior to content,
Who in that conflict, on that fatal day,
With his good hand most gainful succour lent,
And slew most paynims in the martial fray.
But counter to his hopes the battle went,
And his thinned squadrons fled in disarray;
Namus, with other Christian captains taken,
And his pavilion in the rout forsaken.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>X</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>There, lodged by Charles, that gentle bonnibel,
Ordained to be the valiant victor&#39;s meed,
Before the event had sprung into her sell,
And from the combat turned in time of need;
Presaging wisely Fortune would rebel
That fatal day against the Christian creed:
And, entering a thick wood, discovered near,
In a close path, a horseless cavalier.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>With shield upon his arm, in knightly wise,
Belted and mailed, his helmet on his head;
The knight more lightly through the forest hies
Than half-clothed churl to win the cloth of red.
But not from cruel snake more swiftly flies
The timid shepherdess, with startled tread,
Than poor Angelica the bridle turns
When she the approaching knight on foot discerns.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>This was that Paladin, good Aymon&#39;s seed,
Who Mount Albano had in his command;
And late Baiardo lost, his gallant steed,
Escaped by strange adventure from his hand.
As soon as seen, the maid who rode at speed
The warrior knew, and, while yet distant, scanned
The angelic features and the gentle air
Which long had held him fast in Cupid&#39;s snare.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The affrighted damsel turns her palfrey round,
And shakes the floating bridle in the wind;
Nor in her panic seeks to choose her ground,
Nor open grove prefers to thicket blind.
But reckless, pale and trembling, and astound,
Leaves to her horse the devious way to find.
He up and down the forest bore the dame,
Till to a sylvan river&#39;s bank he came.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Here stood the fierce Ferrau in grisly plight,
Begrimed with dust, and bathed with sweat and blood
Who lately had withdrawn him from the fight,
To rest and drink at that refreshing flood:
But there had tarried in his own despite,
Since bending from the bank, in hasty mood,
He dropped his helmet in the crystal tide,
And vainly to regain the treasure tried.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Thither at speed she drives, and evermore
In her wild panic utters fearful cries;
And at the voice, upleaping on the shore,
The Saracen her lovely visage spies.
And, pale as is her cheek, and troubled sore,
Arriving, quickly to the warrior&#39;s eyes
(Though many days no news of her had shown)
The beautiful Angelica is known.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Courteous, and haply gifted with a breast
As warm as either of the cousins two;
As bold, as if his brows in steel were dressed,
The succour which she sought he lent, and drew
His faulchion, and against Rinaldo pressed,
Who saw with little fear the champion true.
Not only each to each was known by sight,
But each had proved in arms his foeman&#39;s might.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Thus, as they are, on foot the warriors vie
In cruel strife, and blade to blade oppose;
No marvel plate or brittle mail should fly,
When anvils had not stood the deafening blows.
It now behoves the palfrey swift to ply
His feet; for while the knights in combat close,
Him vexed to utmost speed, with goading spurs,
By waste or wood the frighted damsel stirs.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>After the two had struggled long to throw
Each other in the strife, and vainly still;
Since neither valiant warrior was below
His opposite in force and knightly skill:
The first to parley with his Spanish foe
Was the good master of Albano&#39;s hill
(As one within whose raging breast was pent
A reckless fire which struggled for a vent).</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Thou think&#39;st,&quot; he said, &quot;to injure me alone,
But know thou wilt thyself as much molest:
For if we fight because yon rising sun
This raging heat has kindled in thy breast.
What were thy gain, and what the guerdon won,
Though I should yield my life, or stoop my crest;
If she shall never be thy glorious meed,
Who flies, while vainly we in battle bleed?</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Then how much better, since our stake&#39;s the same,
Thou, loving like myself, should&#39;st mount and stay
To wait this battle&#39;s end, the lovely dame,
Before she fly yet further on her way.
The lady taken, we repeat our claim
With naked faulchion to that peerless prey:
Else by long toil I see not what we gain
But simple loss and unrequited pain.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The peer&#39;s proposal pleased the paynim well.
And so their hot contention was foregone;
And such fair truce replaced that discord fell,
So mutual wrongs forgot and mischief done;
That for departure seated in his sell,
On foot the Spaniard left not Aymon&#39;s son;
But him to mount his courser&#39;s crupper prayed;
And both united chased the royal maid.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Oh! goodly truth in cavaliers of old!
Rivals they were, to different faith were bred.
Not yet the weary warriors&#39; wounds were cold —
Still smarting from those strokes so fell and dread.
Yet they together ride by waste and wold,
And, unsuspecting, devious dingle thread.
Them, while four spurs infest his foaming sides,
Their courser brings to where the way divides.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And now the warlike pair at fault, for they
Knew not by which she might her palfrey goad,
(Since both, without distinction, there survey
The recent print of hoofs on either road),
Commit the chase to fortune.  By this way
The paynim pricked, by that Rinaldo strode.
But fierce Ferrau, bewildered in the wood,
Found himself once again where late he stood.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Beside the water, where he stoop&#39;d to drink,
And dropt the knightly helmet, — to his cost,
Sunk in the stream; and since he could not think
Her to retrieve, who late his hopes had crossed.
He, where the treasure fell, descends the brink
Of that swift stream, and seeks the morion lost.
But the casque lies so bedded in the sands,
&#39;Twill ask no light endeavour at his hands.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>A bough he severs from a neighbouring tree,
And shreds and shapes the branch into a pole:
With this he sounds the stream, and anxiously
Fathoms, and rakes, and ransacks shelf and hole.
While angered sore at heart, and restless, he
So lingered, where the troubled waters roll,
Breast-high, from the mid river rose upright,
The apparition of an angry knight.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Armed at all points he was, except his head,
And in his better hand a helmet bore:
The very casque, which in the river&#39;s bed
Ferrau sought vainly, toiling long and sore.
Upon the Spanish knight he frowned, and said:
&quot;Thou traitor to thy word, thou perjured Moor,
Why grieve the goodly helmet to resign,
Which, due to me long since, is justly mine?</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Remember, pagan, when thine arm laid low
The brother of Angelica.  That knight
Am I; — thy word was plighted then to throw
After my other arms his helmet bright.
If Fortune now compel thee to forego
The prize, and do my will in thy despite,
Grieve not at this, but rather grieve that thou
Art found a perjured traitor to thy vow.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;But if thou seek&#39;st a helmet, be thy task
To win and wear it more to thy renown.
A noble prize were good Orlando&#39;s casque;
Rinaldo&#39;s such, or yet a fairer crown;
Almontes&#39;, or Mambrino&#39;s iron masque:
Make one of these, by force of arms, thine own.
And this good helm will fitly be bestowed
Where (such thy promise it has long been owed.&quot; ) 
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Bristled the paynim&#39;s every hair at view
Of that grim shade, uprising from the tide,
And vanished was his fresh and healthful hue,
While on his lips the half-formed accents died.
Next hearing Argalia, whom he slew,
(So was the warrior hight that stream beside, ) 

Thus his unknightly breach of promise blame,
He burned all over, flushed with rage and shame.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Nor having time his falsehood to excuse,
And knowing well how true the phantom&#39;s lore,
Stood speechless; such remorse the words infuse.
Then by Lanfusa&#39;s life the warrior swore,
Never in fight, or foray would he use
Helmet but that which good Orlando bore
From Aspramont, where bold Almontes paid
His life a forfeit to the Christian blade.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And this new vow discharged more faithfully
Than the vain promise which was whilom plight;
And from the stream departing heavily,
Was many days sore vexed and grieved in sprite;
And still intent to seek Orlando, he
Roved wheresoe&#39;er he hoped to find the knight.
A different lot befel Rinaldo; who
Had chanced another pathway to pursue.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>For far the warrior fared not, ere he spied,
Bounding across the path, his gallant steed,
And, &quot;Stay, Bayardo mine,&quot; Rinaldo cried,
&quot;Too cruel care the loss of thee does breed.&quot;
The horse for this returned not to his side,
Deaf to his prayer, but flew with better speed.
Furious, in chase of him, Rinaldo hies.
But follow we Angelica, who flies.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Through dreary woods and dark the damsel fled,
By rude unharboured heath and savage height,
While every leaf or spray that rustled, bred
(Of oak, or elm, or beech), such new affright,
She here and there her foaming palfrey sped
By strange and crooked paths with furious flight;
And at each shadow, seen in valley blind,
Or mountain, feared Rinaldo was behind.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>As a young roe or fawn of fallow deer,
Who, mid the shelter of its native glade,
Has seen a hungry pard or tiger tear
The bosom of its bleeding dam, dismayed,
Bounds, through the forest green in ceaseless fear
Of the destroying beast, from shade to shade,
And at each sapling touched, amid its pangs,
Believes itself between the monster&#39;s fangs,</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>One day and night, and half the following day,
The damsel wanders wide, nor whither knows;
Then enters a deep wood, whose branches play,
Moved lightly by the freshening breeze which blows.
Through this two clear and murmuring rivers stray:
Upon their banks a fresher herbage grows;
While the twin streams their passage slowly clear,
Make music with the stones, and please the ear.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Weening removed the way by which she wends,
A thousand miles from loathed Rinaldo&#39;s beat,
To rest herself a while the maid intends,
Wearied with that long flight and summer&#39;s heat.
She from her saddle &#39;mid spring flowers descends
And takes the bridle from her courser fleet.
And loose along the river lets him pass,
Roving the banks in search of lusty grass.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Behold! at hand a thicket she surveys
Gay with the flowering thorn and vermeil rose:
The tuft reflected in the stream which strays
Beside it, overshadowing oaks enclose.
Hollow within, and safe from vulgar gaze,
It seemed a place constructed for repose;
With bows so interwoven, that the light
Pierced not the tangled screen, far less the sight.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Within soft moss and herbage form a bed;
And to delay and rest the traveller woo.
&#39;Twas there her limbs the weary damsel spread,
Her eye-balls bathed in slumber&#39;s balmy dew.
But little time had eased her drooping head,
Ere, as she weened, a courser&#39;s tramp she knew.
Softly she rises, and the river near,
Armed cap-a-pie, beholds a cavalier.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>If friend or foe, she nothing comprehends,
(So hope and fear her doubting bosom tear)
And that adventure&#39;s issue mute attends,
Nor even with a sigh disturbs the air.
The cavalier upon the bank descends;
And sits so motionless, so lost in care,
(His visage propt upon his arm to sight ) 

Changed into senseless stone appeared the knight.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XL</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Pensive, above an hour, with drooping head,
He rested mute, ere he began his moan;
And then his piteous tale of sorrow said,
Lamenting in so soft and sweet a tone,
He in a tiger&#39;s breast had pity bred,
Or with his mournful wailings rent a stone.
And so he sighed and wept; like rivers flowed
His tears, his bosom like an Aetna glowed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Thought which now makes me burn, now freeze with hate,
Which gnaws my heart and rankles at its root!
What&#39;s left to me,&quot; he said, &quot;arrived too late,
While one more favoured bears away the fruit?
Bare words and looks scarce cheered my hopeless state,
And the prime spoils reward another&#39;s suit.
Then since for me nor fruit nor blossom hangs,
Why should I longer pine in hopeless pangs?</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;The virgin has her image in the rose
Sheltered in garden on its native stock,
Which there in solitude and safe repose,
Blooms unapproached by sheperd or by flock.
For this earth teems, and freshening water flows,
And breeze and dewy dawn their sweets unlock:
With such the wistful youth his bosom dresses.
With such the enamored damsel braids her tresses.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;But wanton hands no sooner this displace
From the maternal stem, where it was grown,
Than all is withered; whatsoever grace
It found with man or heaven; bloom, beauty, gone.
The damsel who should hold in higher place
Than light or life the flower which is her own,
Suffering the spoiler&#39;s hand to crop the prize,
Forfeits her worth in every other&#39;s eyes.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;And be she cheap with all except the wight
On whom she did so large a boon bestow.
Ah! false and cruel Fortune! foul despite!
While others triumph, I am drown&#39;d in woe.
And can it be that I such treasure slight?
And can I then my very life forego?
No! let me die; &#39;twere happiness above
A longer life, if I must cease to love.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>If any ask who made this sorrowing,
And pour&#39;d into the stream so many tears,
I answer, it was fair Circassia&#39;s king,
That Sacripant, oppressed with amorous cares.
Love is the source from which his troubles spring,
The sole occasion of his pains and fears;
And he to her a lover&#39;s service paid,
Now well remembered by the royal maid.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He for her sake from Orient&#39;s farthest reign
Roved thither, where the sun descends to rest;
For he was told in India, to his pain,
That she Orlando followed to the west.
He after learned in France that Charlemagne
Secluded from that champion and the rest,
As a fit guerdon, mewed her for the knight
Who should protect the lilies best in fight.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The warrior in the field had been, and viewed,
Short time before, king Charlemagne&#39;s disgrace;
And vainly had Angelica pursued,
Nor of the damsel&#39;s footsteps found a trace.
And this is what the weeping monarch rued,
And this he so bewailed in doleful case:
Hence, into words his lamentations run,
Which might for pity stop the passing sun.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>While Sacripant laments him in this plight,
And makes a tepid fountain of his eyes;
And, what I deem not needful to recite,
Pours forth yet other plaints and piteous cries;
Propitious Fortune will his lady bright
Should hear the youth lament him in such wise:
And thus a moment compassed what, without
Such chance, long ages had not brought about.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>With deep attention, while the warrior weeps,
She marks the fashion of the grief and tears
And words of him, whose passion never sleeps;
Nor this the first confession which she hears.
But with his plaint her heart no measure keeps,
Cold as the column which the builder rears.
Like haughty maid, who holds herself above
The world, and deems none worthy of her love.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>L</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But her from harm amid those woods to keep,
The damsel weened she might his guidance need;
For the poor drowning caitiff, who, chin-deep,
Implores not help, is obstinate indeed.
Nor will she, if she let the occasion sleep,
Find escort that will stand her in such stead:
For she that king by long experience knew
Above all other lovers, kind and true.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But not the more for this the maid intends
To heal the mischief which her charms had wrought,
And for past ills to furnish glad amends
In that full bliss by pining lover sought.
To keep the king in play are all her ends,
His help by some device or fiction bought,
And having to her purpose taxed his daring,
To reassume as wont her haughty bearing.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>An apparition bright and unforeseen,
She stood like Venus or Diana fair,
In solemn pageant, issuing on the scene
From out of shadowy wood or murky lair.
And &quot;Peace be with you,&quot; cried the youthful queen,
&quot;And God preserve my honour in his care,
Nor suffer that you blindly entertain
Opinion of my fame so false and vain!&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Not with such wonderment a mother eyes,
With such excessive bliss the son she mourned
As dead, lamented still with tears and sighs,
Since the thinned files without her boy returned.
— Not such her rapture as the king&#39;s surprise
And ecstasy of joy when he discerned
The lofty presence, cheeks of heavenly hue,
And lovely form which broke upon his view.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He, full of fond and eager passion, pressed
Towards his Lady, his Divinity;
And she now clasped the warrior to her breast,
Who in Catay had haply been less free.
And now again the maid her thoughts addressed
Towards her native land and empery:
And feels, with hope revived, her bosom beat
Shortly to repossess her sumptuous seat.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Her chances all to him the damsel said,
Since he was eastward sent to Sericane
By her to seek the martial monarch&#39;s aid,
Who swayed the sceptre of that fair domain;
And told how oft Orlando&#39;s friendly blade
Had saved her from dishonour, death, and pain;
And how she so preserved her virgin flower
Pure as it blossomed in her natal hour.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Haply the tale was true; yet will not seem
Likely to one of sober sense possessed:
But Sacripant, who waked from worser dream,
In all without a cavil acquiesced:
Since love, who sees without one guiding gleam,
Spies in broad day but that which likes him best:
For one sign of the afflicted man&#39;s disease
Is to give ready faith to things which please.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVII</p>
</blockquote>

Replaced the bridle on his courser fleet,
Grappled his lance, and sprang into his seat.</code></pre><blockquote>

A shield and crest of white; in search of whom
Through the wide forest pricked the weary groom.</code></pre><blockquote>

By the tried valour of a gentle maid.</code></pre><blockquote>

Upon the croup bestowed that damsel sweet,
Reserved to gladder use in safer seat.</code></pre><blockquote>

The sweeping woods which spread about them, sound

Who clears the bush and stream, with furious force
And whatsoever else impedes his course.</code></pre><blockquote>

Two riders ill a foundered jade would bear,
But hither speeds the horse to end that care.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>

His hand to seize him by the flowing rein,

Such are his bone and sinew, that the shock
Of his good heels had split a metal rock.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Then to the maid he goes submissively,
With gentle blandishment and humble mood;
As the dog greets his lord with frolic glee,
Whom, some short season past, he had not viewed.
For good Bayardo had in memory
Albracca, where her hands prepared his food,
What time the damsel loved Rinaldo bold;
Rinaldo, then ungrateful, stern, and cold.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>With her left hand she takes him by the bit,
And with the other pats his sides and chest:
While the good steed (so marvellous his wit),
Lamb-like, obeyed the damsel and caressed.
Meantime the king, who sees the moment fit,
Leapt up, and with his knees the courser pressed.
While on the palfrey, eased of half his weight,
The lady left the croup, and gained the seat.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVII</p>

<pre><code>Then, as at hazard, she directs her sight,
Sounding in arms a man on foot espies,
And glows with sudden anger and despite;

Her more than life esteems the youthful knight,
While she from him, like crane from falcon, flies.
Time was the lady sighed, her passion slighted;
&#39;Tis now Rinaldo loves, as ill requited.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVIII</p>

<pre><code>And this effect two different fountains wrought,
Whose wonderous waters different moods inspire.
Both spring in Arden, with rare virtue fraught:
This fills the heart with amorous desire:
Who taste that other fountain are untaught
Their love, and change for ice their former fire.
Rinaldo drank the first, and vainly sighs;
Angelica the last, and hates and flies.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIX</p>

<pre><code>Mixed with such secret bane the waters glide,
Which amorous care convert to sudden hate;
The maid no sooner had Rinaldo spied,
Than on her laughing eyes deep darkness sate:

To Sacripant, and prayed him not to wait
The near approach of the detested knight,
But through the wood with her pursue his flight.</code></pre><blockquote>

Sufficient to make yonder champion flee?
Already are Albracca&#39;s fights forgot,
And that dread night I singly stood for thee?
That night when I, though naked, was thy shield
Against King Agrican and all his field?&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>She answers not, and knows not in her fear
What &#39;tis she does; Rinaldo is too nigh:

Whose charms such flame had kindled, meet his eye.
But what ensued between the haughty pair</code></pre><blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>ARGUMENT</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>A hermit parts, by means of hollow sprite,
The two redoubted rivals&#39; dangerous play;
Rinaldo goes where Love and Hope invite,
But is dispatched by Charles another way;
Bradamont, seeking her devoted knight,
The good Rogero, nigh becomes the prey
Of Pinabel, who drops the damsel brave
Into the dungeon of a living grave.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>I</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Injurious love, why still to mar accord
Between desires has been thy favourite feat?
Why does it please thee so, perfidious lord,
Two hearts should with a different measure beat?
Thou wilt not let me take the certain ford,
Dragging me where the stream is deep and fleet.
Her I abandon who my love desires,
While she who hates, respect and love inspires.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>II</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Thou to Rinaldo show&#39;st the damsel fair,
While he seems hideous to that gentle dame;
And he, who when the lady&#39;s pride and care,
Paid back with deepest hate her amorous flame,
Now pines, himself, the victim of despair,
Scorned in his turn, and his reward the same.
By the changed damsel in such sort abhorred,
She would choose death before that hated lord.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>III</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He to the Pagan cries: &quot;Forego thy theft,
And down, false felon, from that pilfer&#39;d steed;
I am not wont to let my own be reft.
And he who seeks it dearly pays the deed.
More — I shall take from thee yon lovely weft;
To leave thee such a prize were foul misdeed;
And horse and maid, whose worth outstrips belief,
Were ill, methinks, relinquished to a thief.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Thou liest,&quot; the haughty Saracen retorts,
As proud, and burning with as fierce a flame,
&quot;A thief thyself, if Fame the truth reports:
But let good deeds decide our dubious claim,
With whom the steed or damsel fair assorts:
Best proved by valiant deeds: though, for the dame,
That nothing is so precious, I with thee
(Search the wide world throughout may well agree.&quot; ) 
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>V</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>As two fierce dogs will somtimes stand at gaze,
Whom hate or other springs of strife inspire,
And grind their teeth, while each his foe surveys
With sidelong glance and eyes more red than fire,
Then either falls to bites, and hoarsely bays,
While their stiff bristles stand on end with ire:
So from reproach and menace to the sword
Pass Sacripant and Clermont&#39;s angry lord.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Thus kindling into wrath the knights engage:
One is on foot, the other on his horse:
Small gain to this; for inexperienced page
Would better rein his charger in the course.
For such Baiardo&#39;s sense, he will not wage
War with his master, or put out his force.
For voice, nor hand, nor manage, will he stir,
Rebellious to the rein or goading spur.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He, when the king would urge him, takes the rest,
Or, when he curbs him, runs in giddy rings;
And drops his head beneath his spreading chest,
And plays his spine, and runs an-end and flings.
And now the furious Saracen distressed,
Sees &#39;tis no time to tame the beast, and springs,
With one hand on the pummel, to the ground;
Clear of the restless courser at a bound.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>As soon as Sacripant, with well-timed leap,
Is from the fury of Bayardo freed,
You may believe the battle does not sleep
Between those champions, matched in heart and deed.
Their sounding blades such changeful measure keep,
The hammer-strokes of Vulcan with less speed
Descend in that dim cavern, where he heats,
And Jove&#39;s red thunders on his anvil beats.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Sometimes they lunge, then feign the thrust and parry:
Deep masters of the desperate game they play;
Or rise upon the furious stroke, and carry
Their swords aloft, or stoop and stand at bay.
Again they close, again exhausted tarry;
Now hide, now show themselves, and now give way,
And where one knight an inch of ground has granted,
His foeman&#39;s foot upon that inch is planted.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>X</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>When, lo!  Rinaldo, now impatient grown,
Strikes full at Sacripant with lifted blade;
And he puts forth his buckler made of bone,
And well with strong and stubborn steel inlaid:
Though passing thick, Fusberta cleaves it: groan
Greenwood, and covert close, and sunny glade.
The paynim&#39;s arm rings senseless with the blow,
And steel and bone, like ice, in shivers go.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>When the fair damsel saw, with timid eye,
Such ruin follow from the faulchion&#39;s sway,
She, like the criminal, whose doom is nigh,
Changed her fair countenance through sore dismay,
And deemed that little time was left to fly
If she would not be that Rinaldo&#39;s prey,
Rinaldo loathed by her as much, as he
Doats on the scornful damsel miserably.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>So turned her horse into the gloomy chase,
And drove him through rough path and tangled ally
And oftentimes bent back her bloodless face,
And saw Rinaldo from each thicket sally.
Nor flying long had urged the frantic race,
Before she met a hermit in a valley.
Devotion in his aspect was expressed,
And his long beard descended on his breast.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Wasted he was as much by fasts as age,
And on an ass was mounted, slow and sure;
His visage warranted that never sage
Had conscience more precise or passing pure.
Though in his arteries time had stilled the rage
Of blood, and spake him feeble and demure,
At sight of the delighted damsel, he
Was inly stirred for very charity.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The lady prayed that kindly friar, that he
Would straight conduct her to some haven near,
For that she from the land of France might flee,
And never more of loathed Rinaldo hear.
The hermit, who was skilled in sorcery,
Ceased not to soothe the gentle damsel&#39;s fear.
And with the promise of deliverance, shook
His pocket, and drew forth a secret book.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>This opened, quick and mighty marvel wrought;
For not a leaf is finished by the sage,
Before a spirit, by his bidding brought,
Waits his command in likeness of a page:
He, by the magic writ constrained and taught,
Hastes where the warriors face to face engage,
In the cool shade — but not in cool disport —
And steps between, and stops their battle short.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;In courtesy,&quot; he cried, &quot;let either show
What his foe&#39;s death to either can avail,
And what the guerdon conquest will bestow
On him who in the battle shall prevail,
If Roland, though he has not struck a blow,
Or snapt in fight a single link of mail,
To Paris-town conveys the damsel gay,
Who has engaged you in this bitter fray.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Within an easy mile I saw the peer
Pricking to Paris with that lady bright;
Riding, in merry mood, with laugh and jeer,
And mocking at your fierce and fruitless fight.
Sure it were better, while they yet are near,
To follow peer and damsel in their flight:
For should he once in Paris place his prize
The lady never more shall meet your eyes.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>You might have seen those angry cavaliers
Change at the demon&#39;s tale for rage and shame;
And curse themselves as wanting eyes and ears,
To let their rival cheat them of the dame.
Towards his horse the good Rinaldo steers,
Breathing forth piteous sighs which seem of flame;
And, if he joins Orlando — ere they part —
Swears in his fury he will have his heart.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>So, passing where the prompt Bayardo stood,
Leaps on his back, and leaves, as swift as wind,
Without farewell, his rival in the wood;
Much less invites him to a seat behind.
The goaded charger, in his heat of blood,
Forces whate&#39;er his eager course confined,
Ditch, river, tangled thorn, or marble block;
He swims the river, and he clears the rock.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Let it not, sir, sound strangely in your ear
Rinaldo took the steed thus readily,
So long and vainly followed far and near;
For he, endued with reasoning faculty,
Had not in vice lured on the following peer,
But fled before his cherished lord, that he
Might guide him whither went the gentle dame,
For whom, as he had heard, he nursed a flame.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>For when Angelica, in random dread,
From the pavilion winged her rapid flight,
Bayardo marked the damsel as she fled,
His saddle lightened of Mount Alban&#39;s knight;
Who then on foot an equal combat sped,
Matched with a baron of no meaner might;
And chased the maid by woods, and floods, and strands,
In hopes to place her in the warrior&#39;s hands.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And, with desire to bring him to the maid,
Gallopped before him still with rampant play;
But would not let his master mount, afraid
That he might make him take another way.
So luring on Rinaldo through the shade,
Twice brought him to his unexpected prey;
Twice foiled in his endeavour: once by bold
Ferrau; then Sacripant, as lately told.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Now good Bayardo had believed the tiding
Of that fair damsel, which produced the accord;
And in the devil&#39;s cunning tale confiding,
Renewed his wonted service to his lord.
Behold Rinaldo then in fury riding,
And pushing still his courser Paris-ward!
Though he fly fast, the champion&#39;s wishes go
Faster; and wind itself had seemed too slow.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>At night Rinaldo rests his steed, with pain
To meet Anglante&#39;s lord he burned so sore;
And lent such credit to the tidings vain
Of the false courier of that wizard hoar:
And that day and the next, with flowing rein,
Rode, till the royal city rose before
His eyes; where Charlemagne had taken post,
With the sad remnant of his broken host.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He, for he fears the Afric king&#39;s pursuit,
And sap and siege, upon his vassals calls
To gather in fresh victual, and recruit
And cleanse their ditches, and repair their walls.
And what may best annoy the foes, and suit
For safety, without more delay forestalls;
And plans an embassy to England, thence
To gather fresher forces for defence.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>For he is bent again to try the fate
Of arms in tented field, though lately shamed;
And send Rinaldo to the neighbouring state
Of Britain, which was after England named.
Ill liked the Paladin to cross the strait;
Not that the people or the land he blamed,
But that King Charles was sudden; nor a day
Would grant the valiant envoy for delay.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Rinaldo never executed thing
Less willingly, prevented in his quest
Of that fair visage he was following,
Whose charms his heart had ravished from his breast.
Yet, in obediance to the christian king,
Prepared himself to do the royal hest.
To Calais the good envoy wends with speed,
And the same day embarks himself and steed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And there, in scorn of cautious pilot&#39;s skill
(Such his impatience to regain his home),
Launched on the doubtful sea, which boded ill,
And rolled its heavy billows, white with foam.
The wind, enraged that he opposed his will,
Stirred up the waves; and, &#39;mid the gathering gloom,
So the loud storm and tempest&#39;s fury grew,
That topmast-high the flashing waters flew.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The watchful mariners, in wary sort,
Haul down the mainsail, and attempt to wear;
And would put back in panic to the port,
Whence, in ill hour, they loosed with little care.
— &quot;Not so,&quot; exclaims the wind, and stops them short,
&quot;So poor a penance will not pay the dare.&quot;
And when they fain would veer, with fiercer roar
Pelts back their reeling prow and blusters more.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Starboard and larboard bears the fitful gale,
And never for a thought its ire assuages;
While the strained vessel drives with humble sail
Before the billows, as the tempest rages.
But I, who still pursue a varying tale,
Must leave awhile the Paladin, who wages
A weary warfare with the wind and flood;
To follow a fair virgin of his blood.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXI</p>

<pre><code>I speak of that famed damsel, by whose spear
O&#39;erthrown, King Sacripant on earth was flung;
The worthy sister of the valiant peer,
From Beatrix and good Duke Aymon sprung.
By daring deeds and puissance no less dear
To Charlemagne and France: Since proved among
The first, her prowess, tried by many a test,
Equal to good Rinaldo&#39;s shone confessed.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>A cavalier was suitor to the dame,
Who out of Afric passed with Agramant;
Rogero was his valiant father&#39;s name,

And she, who not of bear or lion came,
Disdained not on the Child her love to plant,
Though cruel Fortune, ill their wishes meeting,
Had granted to the pair a single greeting.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIII</p>

<pre><code>Alone thenceforth she sought her lover (he
Was named of him to whom he owed his birth),

Traversed a wood, and that wood past, a mountain;
And stopt at length beside a lovely fountain.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Through a delicious mead the fountain-rill,

Excludes the fervors of the middle day.
As first the damsel thither turns her eyes,
A youthful cavalier she seated spies;</code></pre><blockquote>

While his moist eyes, and sad and downcast air,
Speak him the broken victim of despair.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Urged by the passion lodged in every breast,
A restless curiosity to know
Of others&#39; cares, the gentle maid addressed
The knight, and sought the occasion of his woe.

And by that gallant bearing, which at sight,
Prepared who saw her for nimble knight.</code></pre><blockquote>

Whose charms with fervid love had fired my breast.
When, as we journey by Rhone&#39;s current, I
A rider on a winged courser spy.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>&quot;From far it shone like flame, and seemed not dight
Of marble or of brick; and in my eye
More wonderful the work, more fair to sight
The walls appeared, as I approached more nigh.
I, after, learned that it was built by sprite
Whom potent fumes had raised and sorcery:
Who on this rock its towers of steel did fix,
Case-hardened in the stream and fire of Styx.</code></pre><blockquote>

Nothing is safe which he would bear away;
Pursued with curses and with threats in vain.
There (fruitless every hope to foil his art)
The felon keeps my love, oh! say my heart.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>&quot;Alas! what more is left me but to eye
Her prison on that cliff&#39;s aerial crest?

Runs round the rugged rock with hopeless quest.
So inaccessible the wild dominion
To whatsoever has not plume and pinion.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>&quot;While I so lingered where those rocks aspire,
I saw a dwarf guide two of goodly strain;
Whose coming added hope to my desire
(Alas! desire and hope alike were vain)
Both barons bold, and fearful in their ire:
The one Gradasso, King of Sericane,
The next, of youthful vigour, was a knight,
Prized in the Moorish court, Rogero hight.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVI</p>

<pre><code>&quot;The dwarf exclaimed, `These champions will assay
Their force with him who dwells on yonder steep,
And by such strange and unattempted way
Spurs the winged courser from his mountain-keep.&#39;
And I to the approaching warriors say,
`Pity, fair sirs, the cruel loss I weep,
And, as I trust, yon daring spoiler slain,
Give my lost lady to my arms again.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVII</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Then how my love was ravished I make known,
Vouching with bitter tears my deep distress.
They proffer aid, and down the path of stone
Which winds about the craggy mountain, press.
While I, upon the summit left alone,
Look on, and pray to God for their success.
Beneath the wily wizard&#39;s castle strong
Extends a little plain, two bow-shots long.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Arrived beneath the craggy keep, the two
Contend which warrior shall begin the fight.
When, whether the first lot Gradasso drew,
Or young Rogero held the honor light,
The King of Sericane his bugle blew,
And the rock rang and fortress on the height;
And, lo! apparelled for the fearful course,
The cavalier upon his winged horse!</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Upwards, by little and by little, springs
The winged courser, as the pilgrim crane
Finds not at first his balance and his wings,
Running and scarcely rising from the plain;
But when the flock is launched and scattered, flings
His pinions to the wind, and soars amain.
So straight the necromancer&#39;s upward flight,
The eagle scarce attempts so bold a height.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>L</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;When it seems fit, he wheels his courser round,
Who shuts his wings, and falling from the sky,
Shoots like a well trained falcon to the ground,
Who sees the quarry, duck or pigeon, fly:
So, through the parting air, with whizzing sound,
With rested lance, he darted from on high;
And while Gradasso scarcely marks the foe
He hears him swooping near, and feels the blow.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;The wizard on Gradasso breaks his spear,
He wounds the empty air, with fury vain.
This in the feathered monster breeds no fear;
Who to a distance shifts, and swoops again.
While that encounter made the Alfana rear,
Thrown back upon her haunches, on the plain.
The Alfana that the Indian monarch rode,
The fairest was that ever man bestrode.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Up to the starry sphere with swift ascent
The wizard soars, then pounces from the sky,
And strikes the young Rogero, who, intent
Upon Gradasso, deems no danger nigh.
Beneath the wizard&#39;s blow the warrior bent,
Which made some deal his generous courser ply;
And when to smite the shifting foe he turned,
Him in the sky, and out of reach discerned.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;His blows Rogero, now Gradasso, bruise
On forehead, bosom, back, or flanks, between;
While he the warrior&#39;s empty blows eschews,
Shifting so quickly that he scarce is seen.
Now this, now that, the wizard seems to choose,
The monster makes such spacious rings and clean,
While the enchanter so deceives the knights,
They view him not, and know not whence he smites.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Between the two on earth and him o&#39; the sky,
Until that hour the warfare lasted there,
Which, spreading wide its veil of dusky dye,
Throughout the world, discolours all things fair.
What I beheld, I say; I add not, I,
A tittle to the tale; yet scarcely dare
To tell to other what I stood and saw;
So strange it seems, so passing Nature&#39;s law.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Well covered in a goodly silken case,
He, the celestial warrior, bore his shield;
But why delayed the mantle to displace
I know not, and its lucid orb concealed.
Since this no sooner blazes in his face,
Than his foe tumbles dazzled on the field;
And while he, like a lifeless body, lies,
Becomes the necromancer&#39;s helpless prize.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;LIke carbuncle, the magic buckler blazed,
No glare was ever seen which shone so bright:
Nor could the warriors choose but fall, amazed
And blinded by the clear and dazzling light.
I, too, that from a distant mountain gazed,
Fell senseless; and when I regained my sight,
After long time, saw neither knights nor page,
Nor aught beside a dark and empty stage.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;This while the fell enchanter, I supposed,
Dragged both the warriors to his prison-cell;
And by strange virtue of the shield disclosed,
I from my hope and they from freedom fell:
And thus I to the turrets, which enclosed
My heart, departing, bade a last farewell.
Now sum my griefs, and say if love combine
Other distress or grief to match with mine.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The knight relapsed into his first disease,
After his melancholy tale was done.
This was Count Pinabel, the Maganzese,
Anselmo d&#39;Altaripa&#39;s faithless son.
He, where the blood ran foul through all degrees,
Disdained to be the only virtuous one;
Nor played a simple part among the base,
Passing in vice the villains of his race.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>With aspect changing still, the beauteous dame
Hears what the mournful Maganzese narrates;
And, at first mention of Rogero&#39;s name,
Her radiant face with eager joy dilates.
But, full of pity, kindles into flame
As Pinabel his cruel durance states.
Nor finds she, though twice told, the story stale;
But makes him oft repeat and piece his tale.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And, after, when she deemed that all was clear,
Cried to the knight, &quot;Repose upon my say.
To thee may my arrival well be dear,
And thou as fortunate account this day.
Straight wend me to the keep, sir cavalier,
Which holds a jewel of so rich a ray:
Nor shalt thou grudge thy labour and thy care,
If envious Fortune do but play me fair.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The knight replied, &quot;Then nought to me remains
But that I yonder mountain-passes show;
And sure &#39;tis little loss to lose my pains,
Where every thing is lost I prize below.
But you would climb yon cliffs, and for your gains
Will find a prison-house, and be it so!
Whate&#39;er betide you, blame yourself alone;
You go forewarned to meet a fate foreshown.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>So said, the cavalier remounts his horse,
And serves the gallant damsel as a guide;
Who is prepared Rogero&#39;s gaol to force,
Or to be slain, or in his prison stied.
When lo! a messenger, in furious course,
Called to the dame to stay, and rode and cried.
This was the post who told Circassa&#39;s lord
What valiant hand had stretched him on the sward.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The courier, who so plied his restless heel,
News of Narbonne and of Montpelier bore:
How both had raised the standard of Castile,
All Acquamorta siding with the Moor;
And how Marseilles&#39; disheartened men appeal
To her, who should protect her straightened shore;
And how, through him, her citizens demand
Counsel and comfort at their captain&#39;s hand.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>This goodly town, with many miles of plain,
Which lie &#39;twixt Var and Rhone, upon the sea,
To her was given by royal Charlemagne:
Such trust he placed in her fidelity.
Still wont with wonder on the tented plain
The prowess of that valiant maid to see.
And now the panting courier, as I said,
Rode from Marseilles to ask the lady&#39;s aid.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Whether or not she should the call obey,
The youthful damsel doubts some little space;
Strong in one balance Fame and Duty weigh,
But softer thoughts both Fame and Duty chase:
And she, at length, resolved the emprize to assay,
And free Rogero from the enchanted place:
Or, should her valour in the adventure fail,
Would with the cherished lover share his jail.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And did with such excuse that post appay,
He was contented on her will to wait:
Then turned the bridle to resume her way
With Pinabel, who seemed no whit elate.
Since of that line he knows the damsel gay,
Held in such open and such secret hate;
And future trouble to himself foresees,
Were he detected as a Maganzese.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>For &#39;twixt Maganza&#39;s and old Clermont&#39;s line
There was an ancient and a deadly feud:
And oft to blows the rival houses came,
And oft in civil blood their hands embrued.
And hence some treason to this gentle dame
In his foul heart, the wicked County brewed;
Or, as the first occasion served, would stray
Out of the road, and leave her by the way.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And so the traitor&#39;s troubled fancy rack
Fear, doubt, and his own native, rancorous mood,
That unawares he issued from the track,
And found himself within a gloomy wood:
Where a rough mountain reared its shaggy back,
Whose stony peak above the forest stood;
The daughter of Dodona&#39;s duke behind,
Dogging his footsteps through the thicket blind.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He, when he saw himself within the brake,
Thought to abandon his unweeting foe;
And to the dame — &quot; &#39;Twere better that we make
For shelter ere the gathering darkness grow;
And, yonder mountain past, (save I mistake)
A tower is seated in the vale below.
Do you expect me then, while from the peak
I measure the remembered place I seek.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>So said, he pushed his courser up the height
Of that lone mountain; in his evil mind
Revolving, as he went, some scheme or sleight
To rid him of the gentle dame behind.
When lo! a rocky cavern met his sight,
Amid those precipices dark and blind:
Its sides descended thirty yards and more,
Worked smooth, and at the bottom was a door.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>A void was at the bottom, where a wide
Portal conducted to an inner room:
From thence a light shone out on every side,
As of a torch illumining the gloom.
Fair Bradamant pursued her faithless guide,
Suspended there, and pondering on her doom:
And came upon the felon where he stood,
Fearing lest she might lose him in the wood.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>When her approach the County&#39;s first intent
Made vain, the wily traitor sought to mend
His toils, and some new stratagem invent
To rid her thence, or bring her to her end.
And so to meet the approaching lady went,
And showed the cave, and prayed her to ascend;
And said that in its bottom he had seen
A gentle damsel of bewitching mien.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Who, by her lovely semblance and rich vest,
Appeared a lady of no mean degree;
But melancholy, weeping, and distressed,
As one who pined there in captivity:
And that when he towards the entrance pressed,
To learn who that unhappy maid might be,
One on the melancholy damsel flew,
And her within that inner cavern drew.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The beauteous Bradamant, who was more bold
Than wary, gave a ready ear; and, bent
To help the maid, imprisoned in that hold,
Sought but the means to try the deep descent.
Then, looking round, descried an elm-tree old,
Which furnished present means for her intent:
And from the tree, with boughs and foliage stored,
Lopt a long branch, and shaped it with her sword.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The severed end she to the count commended,
Then, grasping it, hung down that entrance steep.
With her feet foremost, by her arms suspended:
When asking if she had the skill to leap,
The traitor, with a laugh, his hands extended.
And plunged his helpless prey into the deep.
&quot;And thus,&quot; exclaimed the ruffian, &quot;might I speed
With thee each sucker of thy cursed seed!&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But not, as was the will of Pinabel,
Such cruel lot fair Bradamant assayed;
For striking on the bottom of the cell,
The stout elm-bough so long her weight upstayed,
That, though it split and splintered where it fell,
It broked her fall, and saved the gentle maid.
Some while astounded there the lady lay,</code></pre><blockquote>

Of old Atlantes, learns how from the groom,
Brunello hight, his virtuous ring to take;
And thus the knight&#39;s and others&#39; fetters break.</code></pre><blockquote>

Which sings the sires from whom his lineage grew.</code></pre><blockquote>

The stone, and give my lines a right direction;

Return we now to him, to whom the mail
Of hawberk, shield, and helm, were small protection:
I speak of Pinabel the Maganzeze,
Who hopes the damsel&#39;s death, whose fall he sees.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>The wily traitor thought that damsel sweet
Had perished on the darksome cavern&#39;s floor,
And with pale visages hurried his retreat
From that, through him contaminated door.
And, thence returning, clomb into his seat:
Then, like one who a wicked spirit bore,
To add another sin to evil deed,
Bore off with him the warlike virgin&#39;s steed.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Leave we sometime the wretch who, while he layed
Snares for another, wrought his proper doom;
And turn we to the damsel he betrayed,
Who had nigh found at once her death and tomb.
She, after rising from the rock, dismayed
At her shrewd fall, and gazing through the gloom,
Beheld and passed that inner door, which gave
Entrance to other and more spacious cave.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VII</p>

<pre><code>For the first cavern in a second ended,
Fashioned in form of church, and large and square;
With roof by cunning architect extended
On shafts of alabaster rich and rare.

Before the central altar; and the glare,
Illuminating all the space about,
Shone through the gate, and lit the cave without.</code></pre><blockquote>

A woman issuing forth, the maid addresses,
Barefoot, ungirt, and with dishevelled tresses.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>&quot;O generous Bradamant,&quot; the matron cried,

And here have I long time awaited thee,
To tell what is the heavens&#39; pronounced decree.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>&quot;This is the ancient memorable cave

<pre><code>Drawn by enchantment from his distant lair,
The wizard thought but how to tame the foal;
And, in a month, instructed him to bear
Saddle and bit, and gallop to the goal;
And execute on earth or in mid air,
All shifts of manege, course and caracole;
He with such labour wrought.  This only real,
Where all the rest was hollow and ideal.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>This truth by him with fictions was combined,
Whose sleight passed red for yellow, black for white:
But all his vain enchantments could not blind
The maid, whose virtuous ring assured her sight:
Yet she her blows discharges at the wind;
And spurring here and there prolongs the fight.
So drove or wheeled her steed, and smote at nought,
And practised all she had before been taught.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXI</p>

<pre><code>When she sometime had fought upon her horse,
She from the courser on her feet descends:
To compass and more freely put in force,
As by the enchantress schooled, her wily ends.
The wizard, to display his last resource,
Unweeting the defence, towards her wends.
He bares the shield, secure to blind his foe,
And by the magic light, astonished, throw.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXII</p>

<pre><code>The shield might have been shown at first, nor he
Needed to keep the cavaliers at bay;

The wily cat is sometimes seen to play;
Till waxing wroth, or weary of her prize,
She bites, and at a snap the prisoner dies.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To cat and mouse, in battles fought before,
I liken the magician and his foes;
But the comparison holds good no more:
For, with the ring, the maid against him goes;
Firm and attentive still, and watching sore,
Lest upon her the wizard should impose:
And as she sees him bare the wondrous shield,
Closes her eyes and falls upon the field.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Not that the shining metal could offend,
As wont those others, from its cover freed;
But so the damsel did, to make descend
The vain enchanter from his wondrous steed.
Nor was in ought defeated of her end;
For she no sooner on the grassy mead
Had laid her head, than wheeling widely round,
The flying courser pitched upon the ground.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Already cased again, the shield was hung,
By the magician, at his sadle bow.
He lights and seeks her, who like wolf among
The bushes, couched in thicket, waits the roe;
She without more delay from ambush sprung,
As he drew near, and grappled fast the foe.
That wretched man, the volume by whose aid
He all his battles fought, on earth had laid:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And ran to bind her with a chain, which he,
Girt round about him for such a purpose, wore;
Because he deemed she was no less to be
Mastered and bound than those subdued before.
Him hath the dame already flung; by me
Excused with reason, if he strove not more.
For fearful were the odds between that bold
And puissant maid, and warrior weak and old!</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Intending to behead the fallen foe,
She lifts her conquering hand; but in mid space,
When she beholds his visage, stops the blow,
As if disdaining a revenge so base.
She sees in him, her prowess has laid low,
A venerable sire, with sorrowing face;
Whose hair and wrinkles speak him, to her guess,
Of years six score and ten, or little less.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>&quot;Kill me, for love of God!&quot; (afflicted sore,

To know who was the necromancer hoar
The gentle lady had desire, and why
The tower he in that savage place designed,
Doing such outrage foul to all mankind.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIX</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Nor I, by malice moved, alas!  poor wight,&quot;
(The weeping necromancer answer made,)

From danger sore and death, by love was swayed;
Who, as the skies foreshow, in little season,
Is doomed to die a Christian, and by treason.</code></pre><blockquote>

He follows into France Troyano&#39;s heir.
Him, in my eyes, than son esteemed more dear,
I seek to snatch from France and peril near.</code></pre><blockquote>

Have to this tower conveyed, his lot to share,
That with such partners of his prison pent,
He might the loss of freedom less lament.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXII</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Save they should seek to break their dungeon&#39;s bound,
I grant my inmates every other pleasure.
For whatsoever in the world is found,

One or two captive friends, the rest forbear —
Or (for I crave but this release them all, ) 

So that Rogero but remain my thrall.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIV</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Or if disposed to take him from my sight,
Before the youth be into France conveyed,
Be pleased to free my miserable sprite
From its now rotted bark, long decayed.&quot;
&quot;Prate as thou wilt, I shall restore the knight
To liberty,&quot;  replied the martial maid,
&quot;Nor offer shield and courser to resign,
Which are not in thy gift, — already mine.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Nor were they thine to take or to bestow,
Would it appear that such exchange were wise;
Thou sayest to save him from what stars foreshow,
And cheat an evil influence of the skies
Rogero is confined.  Thou canst not know,
Or knowing, canst not change his destinies:
For, if unknown an ill so near to thee,
Far less mayest thou another&#39;s fate foresee.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVI</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Seek not thy death from me; for the petition
Is made in vain; but if for death thou sigh,
Though the whole world refused the requisition,
A soul resolved would find the means to die.
But ope thy gates to give thy guests dismission
Before thine hand the knot of life untie.&quot;
So spake the scornful dame with angry mock,
Speeding her captive still towards the rock.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Round by the conqueror with the chain he bore,
Atlantes walked, the damsel following nigh,
Who trusted not to the magician hoar,
Although he seemed subdued in port and eye.
Nor many paces went the pair, before
They at the mountain&#39;s foot the cleft espy,
With steps by which the rugged hill to round;
And climb, till to the castle-gate they wound:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Atlantes from the threshold, graved by skill,
With characters and wondrous signs, upturned
A virtuous stone, where, underneath the sill,
Pots, with perpetual fire and secret, burned.
The enchanter breaks them; and at once the hill
To an inhospitable rock is turned.
Nor wall nor tower on any side is seen,
As if no castle there had ever been.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Then from the lady&#39;s toils the wizard clears
His limbs, as thrush escapes the fowler&#39;s snare;
With him as well his castle disappears,
And leaves the prisoned troop in open air;
From their gay lodgings, dames and cavaliers,
Unhoused upon that desert, bleak and bare.
And many at the freedom felt annoy,
Which dispossessed them of such life of joy.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>There is Gradasso, there is Sacripant,
There is Prasildo, noble cavalier,
Who with Rinaldo came from the Levant;
Iroldo, too, Prasildo&#39;s friend sincere.
And there, at last, the lovely Bradamant
Discerns Rogero, long desired and dear;
Who, when assured it was that lady, flew
With joyful cheer to greet the damsel true;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLI</p>

<pre><code>As her he prized before his eyes, his heart,
His life; from that day cherished when she stood
Uncasqued for him, and from the fight apart;
And hence an arrow drank her virgin blood.

And how the lovers wandered in the wood;
Now guided by the sun, and now benighted,
Here first since that encounter reunited.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLII</p>

<pre><code>Now that the stripling sees her here, and knows
Alone she freed him from the wizard&#39;s nest,
He deems, his bosom with such joy overflows,
That he is singly fortunate and blest.
Thither, where late the damsel conquered, goes
The band, descending from the mountain&#39;s crest;
And finds the hippogryph, who bore the shield,
But in its case of crimson silk concealed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To take him by the rein the lady there
Approached, and he stood fast till she was nigh,
Then spread his pinions to the liquid air,
And at short distance lit, half-mountain high:
And, as she follows him with fruitless care,
Not longer flight nor shorter will he try.
&#39;Tis thus the raven, on some sandy beach,
Lures on the dog, and flits beyond his reach.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Gradasso, Sacripant, Rogero, who
With all those other knights below were met,
Where&#39;er, they hope he may return, pursue
The beast, and up and down, each pass beset.

Often to rocky height, and bottom wet,
Among the rocks of the moist valley dropt,
And at short distance from Rogero stopt.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLV</p>

<pre><code>This was Atlantes the enchanter&#39;s deed,
Whose pious wishes still directed were,
To see Rogero from his peril freed:
This was his only thought, his only care;
Who for such end dispatched the winged steed,
Him out of Europe by this sleight to bear.
Rogero took his bridle, but in vain;
For he was restive to the guiding rein.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVI</p>

<pre><code>Now the bold youth from his Frontino flings
(Frontino was his gentle courser hight)
Then leaps on him who towers in air, and stings
And goads his haughty heart with rowels bright.
He runs a short career; then upward springs.
And through mid ether soars a fairer flight
Than hawk, from which the falconer plucks away
In time the blinding hood, and points her prey.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVII</p>

<pre><code>When her Rogero the fair dame discerned,
In fearful peril, soar so high a strain,
She stood long space amazed, ere she returned
To her right judgement, and sound wits again:
And what she erst of Ganymede had learned,
Snatched up to heaven from his paternal reign,
Feared might befall the stripling, born through air,
As gentle as young Ganymede and fair.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVIII</p>

<pre><code>She on Rogero looks with stedfast eyes
As long as feeble sight can serve her use;
And in her mind next tracks him through the skies,
When sight in vain the cherished youth pursues.
And still renewing tears, and groans, and sighs,
Will not afford her sorrow peace or truce.
After the knight had vanished from her view,
Her eyes she on the good Frontino threw.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIX</p>

<pre><code>And lest the courser should become the prey
Of the first traveller, who passed the glen,
Him will not leave; but thence to bear away
Resolves, in trust to see his lord again.
The griffin soars, nor can Rogero stay
The flying courser; while, beneath his ken,
Each peak and promontory sinks in guise,
That he discerns not flat from mountain-rise.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>L</p>

<pre><code>After the hippogryph has won such height,
That he is lessened to a point, he bends
His course for where the sun, with sinking light,
When he goes round the heavenly crab, descends;
And shoots through air, like well-greased bark and light,
Which through the sea a wind propitious sends.
Him leave we on his way, who well shall speed,
And turn we to Rinaldo in his need.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Day after day the good Rinaldo fares,
Forced by the wind, the spacious ocean through;
Now westward borne, and now toward the Bears;
For night and day the ceaseless tempest blew.
Scotland at last her dusky coast uprears,

Which, through its shadowy groves of ancient oak,
Oft echoes to the champion&#39;s sturdy stroke.</code></pre><blockquote>

But to the session Ariodantes led,
Strives with his brother in disguise.  In season
Rinaldo comes to venge the secret treason.</code></pre><blockquote>

On earth, or who unite in friendly wise,

Such poison in the human heart has shed,

Why in my tender years, against all right,
Those caitiffs would have dome me foul despite.</code></pre><blockquote>

From the projecting balcony let fall.</code></pre><blockquote>

He ruled my heart, how absolute his sway!
Since this he owned, and thought no shame to move
Me to assist him in his second love.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Unlike what he bore me, he said, indeed,
That was not true which he for her displayed;
But so pretending love, he hoped to speed,
And celebrate due spousals with the maid.
He with her royal sire might well succeed,
Were she consenting to the boon he prayed;
For after our good king, for wealth and birth
In all the realm, was none of equal worth.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Me he persuades, if through my ministry
He the king&#39;s son-in-law elected were,
For I must know he next the king would be
Advanced as high, as subject could repair,
The merit should be mine, and ever he
So great a benefit in mind would bear;
And he would cherish me above his bride,
And more than every other dame beside.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;I, who to please him was entirely bent,
Who never could or would gainsay his will,
Upon those days alone enjoy content,
When I find means his wishes to fulfil:
And snatch at all occasions which present
A mode, his praise and merits to instil:
And for my lover with all labour strain,
And industry, Geneura&#39;s love to gain.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;With all my heart, in furtherance of his suit,
I wrought what could be done, God truly knows;
But with Geneura this produced no friut,
Nor her to grace my duke could I dispose.
For that another love had taken root
In her, whose every fond affection flows
Towards a gentle knight of courteous lore,
Who sought our Scotland from a distant shore:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;And with a brother, then right young, to stay
In our king&#39;s court, came out of Italy:
And there of knightly arms made such assay,
Was none in Britain more approved than he;
Prized by the king, who (no ignoble pay),
Rewarding him like his nobility,
Bestowed upon the youth, with liberal hand,
Burghs, baronies, and castles, woods and land.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Dear to the monarch, to the daughter still
This lord was dearer, Ariodantes hight.
Her with affection might his valour fill;
But knowledge of his love brought more delight.
Nor old Vesuvius, nor Sicilia&#39;s hill,
Nor Troy-town, ever, with a blaze so bright,
Flamed, as with all his heart, the damsel learned,
For love of her young Ariodantes burned.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;The passion which she bore the lord, preferred
And loved with perfect truth and all her heart,
Was the occassion I was still unheard;
Nor hopeful answer would she e&#39;er impart:
And still the more my lover&#39;s suit I stirred,
And to obtain his guerdon strove with art,
Him she would censure still, and ever more
Was strengthened in the hate she nursed before.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;My wayward lover often I excite
So vain and bootless an emprize to quit;
Nor idly hope to turn her stedfast sprite,
Too deeply with another passion smit;
And make apparent to the Scottish knight,
Ariodantes such a flame had lit
In the young damsel&#39;s breast, that seas in flood
Would not have cooled one whit her boiling blood.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;This Polinesso many times had heard
From me (for such the Scottish baron&#39;s name)
Well warranted by sight as well as word,
How ill his love was cherished by the dame.
To see another to himself preferred
Not only quenched the haughty warrior&#39;s flame,
But the fond love, which in his bosom burned
Into despiteful rage and hatred turned.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Between Geneura and her faithful knight
Such discord and ill will he schemed to shed,
And put betwixt the pair such foul despite.
No time should heal the quarrel he had bred;
Bringing such scandal on that damsel bright,
The stain should cleave to her, alive or dead:
Nor, bent to wreck her on this fatal shelf,
Counselled with me, or other but himself.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `Dalinda mine,&#39; he said, his project brewed,
(Dalinda is my name `you needs must know, ) 

That from the root although the trunk be hewed,
Successive suckers many times will grow.
Thus my unhappy passion is renewed,
Tenacious still of life, and buds; although
Cut off by ill success, with new increase:
Nor, till I compass my desire, will cease.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `Nor hope of pleasure this so much has wrought,
As that to compass my design would please;
And, if not in effect, at least in thought
To thrive, would interpose some little ease.
Then every time your bower by me is sought,
When in her bed Geneura slumbers, seize
What she puts off, and be it still your care
To dress yourself in all her daily wear.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `Dispose your locks and deck yourself as she
Goes decked; and, as you can, with cunning heed,
Imitate her; then to the gallery
You, furnished with the corded stair, shall speed:
I shall ascend it in the phantasy
That you are she, of whom you wear the weed:
And hope, that putting on myself this cheat,
I in short time shall quench my amorous heat.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;So said the knight; and I, who was distraught,
And all beside myself, was not aware
That the design, in which he help besought,
Was manifestly but too foul a snare;
And in Geneura&#39;s clothes disguised, as taught,
Let down (so oft I used the corded stair. ) 

Nor I the traitor&#39;s foul deceit perceived,
Until the deadly mischief was achieved.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;The duke, this while, to Ariodantes&#39; ears
Had these, or other words like these, addressed;
(For leagued in friendship were the cavaliers,
Till, rivals, they pursued this common quest)
&quot;I marvel, since you are of all my peers
He, whom I must have honoured and caressed,
And held in high regard, and cherished still,
You should my benefits repay so ill.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `I am assured you comprehend and know
Mine and Geneura&#39;s love, and old accord;
And, in legitimate espousal, how
I am about to claim her from my lord:
Then why disturb my suit, and why bestow
Your heart on her who offers no reward?
By Heaven, I should respect your claim and place,
Were your condition mine, and mine your case.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `And I,&#39; cried Ariodantes, `marvel more&#39;
(In answer to the Scottish lord `at you, ) 

Since I of her enamoured was, before
That gentle damsel ever met your view;
And know, you are assured how evermore
We two have loved; — was never love more true —
Are certain she alone would share my lot;
And are as well assured she loves you not.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `Why have not I from you the same respect,
To which, for friendship past, you would pretend
From me; and I should bear you in effect,
If your hope stood more fair to gain its end?
No less than you, to wed her I expect;
And if your fortunes here my wealth transcend,
As favoured of the king, as you, above
You, am I happy in his daughter&#39;s love.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `Of what a strange mistake,&#39; (to him replied
The duke `your foolish passion is the root! ) 

You think yourself beloved; I, on my side,
Believe the same; this try we by the fruit.
You of your own proceeding nothing hide,
And I will tell the secrets of my suit:
And let the man who proves least favoured, yield,
Provide himself elsewhere, and quit the field.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `I am prepared, if such your wish, to swear
Nothing of what is told me to reveal;
And will that you assure me, for your share,
You shall what I recount as well conceal.&#39;
Uniting in the pact, the rival pair
Their solemn vows upon the Bible seal:
And when they had the mutual promise plighted,
Ariodantes first his tale recited.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Then plainly, and by simple facts averred,
How with Geneura stood his suit, avows;
And how, engaged by writing and by word,
She swore she would not be another&#39;s spouse.
How, if to him the Scottish king demurred,
Virgin austerity she ever vows;
And other bridal bond for aye eschewed,
To pass her days in barren solitude.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Then added, how he hoped by worth, which he
Had more than once avouched, with knightly brand,
And yet might vouch, to the prosperity
And honour of the king, and of his land,
To please so well that monarch, as to be
By him accounted worthy of the hand
Of his fair child, espoused with his consent:
Since he in this her wishes would content.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Then so concludes — `I stand upon this ground,
Nor I intruder fear, encroaching nigh;
Nor seek I more; &#39;tis here my hopes I bound;
Nor, striving for Geneura&#39;s love, would I
Seek surer sign of it than what is found,
By God allowed, in wedlock&#39;s lawful tie;
And other suit were hopeless, am I sure,
So excellent she is, and passing pure.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;When Ariodantes had, with honest mind,
Told what reward he hoped should quit his pain,
False Polinesso, who before designed
To make Geneura hateful to her swain,
Began — `Alas!  you yet are far behind
My hopes, and shall confess your own are vain;
And say, as I the root shall manifest
Of my good fortune, I alone am blest.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `With you Geneura feigns, nor pays nor prizes
Your passion, which with hopes and words is fed;
And, more than this, your foolish love despises:
And this to me the damsel oft has said,
Of hers I am assured; of no surmises,
Vain, worthless words, or idle promise bred.
And I to you the fact in trust reveal,
Though this I should in better faith conceal.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `There passes not a month, but in that space
Three nights, four, six, and often ten, the fair
Receives me with that joy in her embrace,
Which seems to second so the warmth we share.
This you may witness, and shall judge the case;
If empty hopes can with my bliss compare.
Then since my happier fortune is above
Your wishes, yield, and seek another love.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `This will I not believe,&#39; in answer cried
Ariodantes, `well assured you lie,
And that you have this string of falsehoods tied,
To scare me from the dear emprize I try.
But charge, so passing foul, you shall abide,
And vouch what you have said in arms; for I
Not only on your tale place no reliance;
But as a traitor hurl you my defiance.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XL</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;To him rejoined the duke, &#39;I ween &#39;twere ill
To take the battle upon either part,
Since surer mean our purpose may fulfill;
And if it please, my proof I can impart.&#39;
Ariodantes trembled, and a chill
Went through his inmost bones; and sick at heart,
Had he in full believed his rival&#39;s boast,
Would on the spot have yielded up the ghost.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;With wounded heart, and faltering voice, pale face,
And mouth of gall, he answered, &#39;When I see
Proofs of thy rare adventure, and the grace
With which the fair Geneura honours thee,
I promise to forego the fruitless chase
Of one, to thee so kind, so cold to me.
But think not that thy story shall avail,
Unless my very eyes confirm the tale.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `To warn in due time shall be my care.&#39;
(Said Polinesso and so went his way. ) 

Two nights were scarecly passed, ere his repair
To the known bower was fixed for the assay.
And, ready now to spring his secret snare,
He sought his rival on the appointed day,
And him to hide, the night ensuing, prayed
I&#39; the street, which none their habitation made.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;And to the youth a station over-right
The balcony, to which he clambered, shows.
Ariodantes weened, this while, the knight
Would him to seek that hidden place dispose,
As one well suited to his fell despite,
And, bent to take his life, this ambush chose,
Under the false pretence to make him see
What seemed a sheer impossibility.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;To go the peer resolved, but in such guise,
He should not be with vantage overlaid;
And should he be assaulted by surprise,
He need not be by fear of death dismay&#39;d.
He had a noble brother, bold and wise,
First of the court in arms; and on his aid,
Lurcanio hight, relied with better heart
Than if ten others fought upon his part.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;He called him to his side, and willed him take
His arms; and to the place at evening led:
Yet not his secret purpose would be break;
Nor this to him, or other would have read:
Him a stone&#39;s throw removed he placed, and spake:
` — Come if thou hearest he cry,&#39; the warrior said;
`But as thou lovest me (whatsoe&#39;er befall)
Come not and move not, brother, till I call.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `Doubt not&#39; (the valiant brother said `but go&#39;; ) 

And thither went that baron silently,
And hid within the lonely house, and low,
Over against my secret gallery.
On the other side approached the fraudful foe,
So pleased to work Geneura&#39;s infamy;
And, while I nothing of the cheat divine,
Beneath my bower renews the wonted sign.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;And I in costly robe, in which were set
Fair stripes of gold upon a snowy ground,
My tresses gathered in a golden net,
Shaded with tassels of vermillion round,
Mimicking fashions, which were only met
In fair Geneura, at the accustomed sound,
The gallery mount, constructed in such mode,
As upon every side my person showed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;This while Lurcanio, either with a view
To snares which might beset his brother&#39;s feet,
Or with the common passion to pursue,
And play the spy on other, where the street
Was darkest, and its deepest shadows threw,
Followed him softly to his dim retreat:
And not ten paces from the knight aloof,
Bestowed himself beneath the self same roof.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Suspecting nought, I seek the balcony,
In the same habits which I mentioned, dressed;
As more than once or twice (still happily)
I did before; meanwhile the goodly vest
Was in the moonlight clearly seen, and I,
In aspect not unlike her, in the rest
Resembling much Geneura&#39;s shape and cheer,
One visage well another might appear.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>L</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;So much the more, that there was ample space
Between the palace and the ruined row:
Hence the two brothers, posted in that place,
Were lightly cheated by the lying show.
Now put yourself in his unhappy case,
And figure what the wretched lover&#39;s woe,
When Polinesso climbed the stair, which I
Cast down to him, and scaled the gallery.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Arrived, my arms about his neck I throw,
Weening that we unseen of others meet,
And kiss his lips and face with loving show,
As him I hitherto was wont to greet;
And he assayed, with more than wonted glow,
Me to caress, to mask his hollow cheat.
Led to the shameful spectacle, aghast,
That other, from afar, viewed all that passed,</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;And fell into such fit of deep despair,
He there resolved to die; and, to that end,
Planted the pommel of his falchion bare
I&#39; the ground, its point against his breast to bend.
Lurcanio, who with marvel by that stair,
Saw Polinesso to my bower ascend,
But knew not who the wight, with ready speed
Sprang forward, when he saw his brother&#39;s deed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;And hindered him in that fell agony
From turning his own hand against his breast.
Had the good youth been later, or less nigh,
To his assistance he had vainly pressed.
Then, `Wretched brother, what insanity.&#39;
(He cried `your better sense has dispossessed? ) 

Die for a woman!  rather let her kind
Be scattered like the mist before the wind!</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `Compass her death!  &#39;tis well deserved; your own
Reserve, as due to more illustrious fate.
&#39;Twas well to love, before her fraud was shown,
But she, once loved, now more deserves your hate:
Since, witnessed by your eyes, to you is known
A wanton of what sort you worshipped late.
Her fault before the Scottish king to attest,
Reserve those arms you turn against your breast.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Ariodantes, so surprised, forewent,
Joined by his brother, the design in show;
But resolute to die, in his intent
Was little shaken: Rising thence to go,
He bears away a heart not simply rent,
But dead and withered with excess of woe:
Yet better comfort to Lurcanio feigns,
As if the rage were spent which fired his veins.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;The morn ensuing, without further say
To his good brother, or to man beside,
He from the city took his reckless way
With deadly desperation for his guide;
Nor, save the duke and knight, for many a day
Was there who knew what moved the youth to ride:
And in the palace, touching this event,
And in the realm, was various sentiment.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;But eight days past or more, to Scotland&#39;s court
A traveller came, and to Geneura he
Related tidings of disastrous sort;
That Ariodantes perished in the sea:
Drowned of his own free will was the report,
No wind to blame for the calamity!
Since from a rock, which over ocean hung,
Into the raging waves he headlong sprung;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `Who said, before he reached that frowning crest,
To me, whom he encountered by the way,
Come with me, that your tongue may manifest,
And what betides me to Geneura say;
And tell her, too, the occasion of the rest,
Which you shall witness without more delay;
In having seen too much, the occasion lies;
Happy had I been born without these eyes!&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `By chance, upon a promontory we
Were standing, overright the Irish shore;
When, speaking thus on that high headland, he
Plunged from a rock amid the watery roar.
I saw him leap, and left him in the sea;
And, hurrying thence, to you the tidings bore.&#39;
Geneura stood amazed, her colour fled,
And, at the fearful tale, remained half dead.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;O God!  what said, what did she, when alone,
She on her faithful pillow layed her head!
She beat her bosom, and she tore her gown,
And in despite her golden tresses shed;
Repeating often, in bewildered tone,
The last sad words which Ariodantes said; —
That the sole source of such despair, and such
Disaster, was that he had seen too much.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Wide was the rumour scattered that the peer
Had slain himself for grief; nor was the cry
By courtly dame, or courtly cavalier,
Or by the monarch, heard with tearless eye.
But, above all the rest, his brother dear
Was whelmed with sorrow of so deep a dye,
That, bent to follow him, he well nigh turned
His hand against himself, like him he mourned.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;And many times repeating in his thought,
It was Geneura who his brother slew,
Who was to self-destruction moved by nought
But her ill deed, which he was doomed to view,
So on his mind the thirst of vengeance wrought,
And so his grief his season overthrew;
That he thought little, graced of each estate,
To encounter king and people&#39;s common hate;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;And, when the throng was fullest in the hall,
Stood up before the Scottish king, and said,
`Of having marred my brother&#39;s wits withal,
Sir king, and him to his destruction led,
Your daughter only can I guilty call:
For in his inmost soul such sorrow bred
The having seen her little chastity,
He loathed existence, and preferred to die.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; `He was her lover; and for his intent
Was honest, this I seek not, I, to veil;
And to deserve her by his valour meant
Of thee, if faithful service might avail;
But while he stood aloof, and dared but scent
The blossoms, he beheld another scale,
Scale the forbidden tree with happier boot,
And bear away from him the wished-for fruit.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Then added, how into the gallery came
Geneura, and how dropped the corded stair;
And how into the chamber of the dame
Had climbed a leman of that lady fair;
Who, for disguise (he knew not hence his name),
Had changed his habits, and concealed his hair;
And, in conclusion, vowed that every word
So said, he would avouch with lance and sword.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;You may divine how grieves the sire, distraught
With woe, when he the accusation hears:
As well that what he never could have thought,
He of his daughter learns with wondering ears,
As that he knows, if succour be not brought
By cavalier, that in her cause appears,
Who may upon Lurcanio prove the lie,
He cannot choose, but doom the maid to die.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;I do not think our Scottish law to you
Is yet unknown, which sentences to fire
The miserable dame, or damsel, who
Grants other than her wedded lord&#39;s desire.
She dies, unless a champion, good and true,
Arm on her side before a month expire;
And her against the accuser base maintain
Unmeriting such death, and free from stain.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;The king has made proclaim by town and tower,
(For he believes her wronged, his child to free)
Her he shall have to wife, with ample dower,
Who saves the royal maid from infamy.
But each to the other looks, and to this hour
No champion yet, &#39;tis said, appears: for he,
Lurcanio, is esteemed so fierce in fight,
It seems as he were feared of every knight.

&quot;And evil Fate has willed her brother dear,
Zerbino, is not here the foe to face;
Since many months has roved the cavalier,
Proving his matchless worth with spear and mace;
For if the valiant champion were more near,
(Such is his courage or in any place, ) 

Whither in time the news might be conveyed,
He would not fail to bear his sister aid.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;The king, mean time, who would the quest pursue,
And by more certain proof than combat, try
If the accuser&#39;s tale be false or true,
And she deserve, or merit not, to die,
Arrests some ladies of her retinue,
That, as he weens, the fact can verify.
Whence I foresaw, that if I taken were,
Too certain risque the duke and I must share.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;That very night I from the palace flee,
And to the duke repair, escaped from court;
And, were I taken, make him plainly see
How much it either&#39;s safety would import:
He praised, and bade me of good courage be,
And, for his comfort, prayed me to resort
To a strong castle which he held hard by;
And gave me two to bear me company.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;With what full proofs, sir stranger, you have heard,
I of my love assured the Scottish peer;
And clearly can discern, if so preferred,
That lord was justly bound to hold me dear.
Mark, in conclusion, what was my reward;
The glorious meed of my great merit hear!
And say if woman can expect to earn,
However well she love, her love&#39;s return.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;For this perfidious, foul, ungrateful man,
At length suspicious of my faith and zeal,
And apprehending that his wily plan,
In course of time, I haply might reveal,
Feigned that meanwhile the monarch&#39;s anger ran
Too high, he would withdraw me, and conceal
Within a fortress of his own, where I
(Such was his real end was doomed to die. ) 
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;For secretly the duke enjoined the guide,
Who with me through the gloomy forest went,
The worthy guerdon of a faith so tried,
To slay me; and had compassed his intent,
But for your ready succour, when I cried.
Behold!  what wages love&#39;s poor slaves content.&quot;
Thus to Rinaldo did Dalinda say,
As they together still pursued their way.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXV</p>

<pre><code>Above all other fortune, to the knight
Was welcome to have found the gentle maid,

Persuaded of the calumny&#39;s disproof,
He with more courage warred in her behoof.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And for St. Andrew&#39;s town, with eager speed,
Where was the king with all his family,
And where the single fight, in listed mead,
Upon his daughter&#39;s quarrel, was to be,
The good Rinaldo pricked, nor spared his steed,
Until, within an easy distance, he
Now near the city, met a squire who brought
More recent tidings than the damsel taught:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>That thither had repaired a stranger knight,
To combat in Geneura&#39;s quarrel bent,
With ensigns strange, not known of living wight,
Since ever close concealed the warrior went;
Not, since he had been there, had bared to sight
His visage, aye within his helmet pent:
And that the very squire who with him came,
Swore that he knew not what the stranger&#39;s name.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Not far they ride before the walls appear,
And now before the gate their coursers stand.
To advance the sad Dalinda was in fear,
Yet followed, trusting in Rinaldo&#39;s brand.
The gate was shut, and to the porter near,
What this implies Rinaldo makes demand:
To him was said, the people, one and all,
Were trooped to see a fight without the wall:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Beyond the city, fought upon accord,
Between Lurcanio and a stranger knight;
Where, on a spacious meadow&#39;s level sward,
The pair already had begun the fight.
The porter opened to Mount Alban&#39;s lord,
And straight behind the peer the portal hight.
Rinaldo through the empty city rode,
But in a hostel first the dame bestowed:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And will that she (he will not long delay
To seek her there till his return repose; ) 

And quickly to the lists pursued his way,
Where the two made that fell exchange of blows,
And strove and struggled yet in bloody fray.
Lurcanio&#39;s heart with vengeful hatred glows
Against Geneura; while that other knight
As well maintains the quarrel for her right.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Six knights on foot within the palisade
Stand covered with the corslet&#39;s iron case;
Beneath the Duke of Albany arrayed,
Borne on a puissant steed of noble race:
Who there, as lord high-constable obeyed,
Was keeper of the field and of the place,
And joyed Geneura&#39;s peril to espy
With swelling bosom and exulting eye.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Rinaldo pierces through the parted swarm,
(So wide is felt the good Bayardo&#39;s sway,)
And he who hears the courser come in storm,
Halts not, in his desire to make him way:
Above is seen Rinaldo&#39;s lofty form,
The flower of those who mix in martial fray.
He stops his horse before the monarch&#39;s chair,
While all to hear the paladin repair.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Dread sir,&quot; to him the good Rinaldo said,
&quot;Let not the pair this combat longer ply;
Since whichsoever of the two falls dead,
Know, that you let him perish wrongfully:
This thinks that he is right, and is misled,
Vouches the false, and knows not &#39;tis a lie:
Since that which brought his brother to his end,
Moves him in causeless battle contend.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;That, in pure gentleness, with little care
If what he here maintains be wrong or right,
Because he would preserve a maid so fair,
Perils his person in the furious fight.
To injured innocence I safety bear,
And to the evil man its opposite.
But first, for love of God, the battle stay;
Then list, sir king, to what I shall display.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>So moved the king the grave authority
Of one who seemed so worthy, by his cheer,
That he made sign the battle should not be
Further continued then with sword or spear:
To whom, together with his chivalry,
And barons of the realm and others near
Rinaldo all the treacherous plot displayed,
Which Polinesso for Geneura layed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Next that he there in arms would testify
The truth of what he vouched, the warrior cried.
False Polinesso, called, with troubled eye,
Stood forth, but daringly the tale denied.
To him the good Rinaldo in reply;
&quot;By deeds be now the doubtful quarrel tried.&quot;
The field was cleared, and, ready armed, the foes,
Without more let, in deadly duel close.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>How was the hope to king and people dear,
The proof might show Geneura innocent!
All trust that God will make the treason clear,
And show she was accused with foul intent:
For Polinesso, greedy and severe,
And proud was held, and false and fraudulent.
So that none there, of all assembled, deemed
It marvel, if the knight such fraud had schemed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>False Polinesso, with a mien distressed,
A pallid cheek, and heart which thickly beat,
At the third trumpet, laid his lance in rest;
As well Rinaldo spurred the knight to meet,
And levelled at his evil foeman&#39;s breast,
Eager to finish at a single heat.
Nor counter to his wish was the event;
Since through the warrior half his weapon went.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Him, through his breast, impaled upon the spear,
More than six yards beyond his horse he bore.
With speed alighted Mount Albano&#39;s peer,
And, ere he rose, unlaced the helm he wore:
But he for mercy prayed with humble cheer,
Unfit to strive in joust or warfare more:
And, before king and court, with faltering breath,
Confessed the fraud which brought him to his death.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XC</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He brings not his confession to a close,
And pangs of death the failing accents drown:
The prince, who ended saw his daughter&#39;s woes,
Redeemed from death and scorn, her virtue shown,
With more delight and rapture overflows,
Than if he, having lost his kingly crown,
Then saw it first upon his head replaced;
So that he good Rinaldo singly graced.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XCI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And when, through his uplifted casque displaid,
Features, well known before, the king descried,
His thanks to God with lifted hands he paid,
That he had deigned such succour to provide.
That other cavalier, who bared his blade,
Unknown of all, upon Geneura&#39;s side,
And thither came from far, his aid to impart,
Looked upon all that passed, and stood apart.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XCII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Him the good king entreated to declare
His name, or, at the least, his visage shew;
That he might grace him with such guerdon fair,
As to his good intent was justly due.
The stranger, after long and earnest prayer,
Lifted to covering casque, and bared to view</code></pre><blockquote>

<h4>Canto 6</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>ARGUMENT</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Ariodantes has, a worthy meed,
With his loved bride, the fief of Albany.
Meantime Rogero, on the flying steed,
Arrives in false Alcina&#39;s empery:
There from a myrtle-tree her every deed,
A human myrtle hears, and treachery,
And thence would go; but they who first withdrew
Him from one strife, engage him in a new.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>I</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Wretched that evil man who lives in trust
His secret sin is safe in his possession!
Since, if nought else, the air, the very dust
In which the crime is buried, makes confession,
And oftentimes his guilt compels the unjust,
Though sometime unarraigned in worldly session,
To be his own accuser, and bewray,
So God has willed, deeds hidden from the day.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>II</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The unhappy Polinesso hopes had nursed,
Wholly his secret treason to conceal.
By taking off Dalinda, who was versed
In this, and only could the fact reveal;
And adding thus a second to his first
Offence, but hurried on the dread appeal,
Which haply he had stunned, at least deferred;
But he to self-destruction blindly spurred.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>III</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And forfeited estate, and life, and love
Of friends at once, and honour, which was more.
The cavalier unknown, I said above,
Long of the king and court entreated sore,
At length the covering helmet did remove,
And showed a visage often seen before,
The cherished face of Ariodantes true,
Of late lamented weeping Scotland through;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Ariodantes, whom with tearful eye
His brother and Geneura wept as dead,
And king, and people, and nobility:
Such light his goodness and his valour shed.
The pilgrim therefore might appear to lie
In what he of the missing warrior said.
Yet was it true that from a headland, he
Had seen him plunge into the foaming sea.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>V</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But, as it oft befalls despairing wight,
Who grisly Death desires till he appear;
But loathes what he had sought, on nearer sight;
So painful seems the cruel pass and drear.
Thus, in the sea engulphed, the wretched knight,
Repentant of his deed, was touched with fear;
And, matchless both for spirit and for hand,
Beat back the billows, and returned to land.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And, now despising, as of folly bred,
The fond desire which did to death impell,
Thence, soaked and dripping wet, his way did tread,
And halted at a hermit&#39;s humble cell:
And housed within the holy father&#39;s shed,
There secretly awhile designed to dwell;
Till to his ears by rumour should be voiced,
If his Geneura sorrowed or rejoiced.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>At first he heard that, through excess of woe,
The miserable damsel well-nigh died:
For so abroad the doleful tidings go,
&#39;Twas talked of in the island, far and wide:
Far other proof than that deceitful show,
Which to his cruel grief he thought he spied!
And next against the fair Geneura heard
Lurcanio to her sire his charge preferred:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Nor for his brother felt less enmity
Than was the love he lately bore the maid;
For he too foul, and full of cruelty,
Esteemed the deed, although for him essayed;
And, hearing after, in her jeopardy,
That none appeared to lend the damsel aid,
Because so puissant was Lurcanio&#39;s might,
All dreaded an encounter with the knight,</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And that who well the youthful champion knew,
Believed he was so wary and discreet,
That, had what he related been untrue,
He never would have risqued so rash a feat,
— For this the greater part the fight eschew,
Fearing in wrongful cause the knight to meet —
Ariodantes (long his doubts are weighed)
Will meet his brother in Geneura&#39;s aid.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>X</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Alas! (he said I cannot bear to see ) 

Thus by my cause the royal damsel die;
My death too bitter and too dread would be,
Did I, before my own, her death descry;
For still my lady, my divinity
She is; — the light and comfort of my eye.
Her, right or wrong, I cannot choose but shield,
And for her safety perish in the field.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;I know I choose the wrong, and be it so!
And in the cause shall die: nor this would move;
But that, alas!  my death, as well I know,
Will such a lovely dame&#39;s destruction prove,
To death I with one only comfort go,
That, if her Polinesso bears her love,
To her will manifestly be displayed,
That hitherto he moves not in her aid.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;And me, so wronged by her, the maid shall view
Encounter death in her defence; and he,
My brother, who such flames of discord blew,
Shall pay the debt of vengeance due to me.
For well I ween to make Lurcanio rue
(Informed of the event his cruelty, ) 

Who will have thought to venge me with his brand,
And will have slain me with his very hand.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He, having this concluded in his thought,
Made new provision of arms, steed, and shield;
Black was the vest and buckler which he bought,
Where green and yellow striped the sable field:
By hazard found, with him a squire he brought,
A stranger in that country; and, concealed
(As is already told the unhappy knight, ) 

Against his brother came, prepared for fight.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And yielding to his natural inclination,
And at the suit of all his court beside,
And mostly at Rinaldo&#39;s instigation,
Assigned the youth the damsel as his bride.
Albany&#39;s duchy, now in sequestration,
Late Polinesso&#39;s, who in duel died,
Could not be forfeited in happier hour;
Since this the monarch made his daughter&#39;s dower.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Rinaldo for Dalinda mercy won;
Who from her fault&#39;s due punishment went free.
She, satiate of the world, (and this to shun,
The damsel so had vowed to God will flee: ) 

And hence, in Denmark&#39;s land, to live a nun,
Straight from her native Scotland sailed the sea.
But it is time Rogero to pursue,
Who on his courser posts the welkin through.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Although Rogero is of constant mind,
Not from his cheek the wonted hues depart.
I ween that faster than a leaf i&#39; the wind
Fluttered within his breast the stripling&#39;s heart.
All Europe&#39;s region he had left behind
In his swift course; and, issuing in that part,
Passed by a mighty space, the southern sound
Where great Alcides fixed the sailor&#39;s bound.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>That hippogryph, huge fowl, and strange to sight,
Bears off the warrior with such rapid wing,
He would have distanced, in his airy flight,
The thunder bearing bird of Aether&#39;s king:
Nor other living creature soars such height,
Him in his mighty swiftness equalling.
I scarce believe that bolt, or lightning flies,
Or darts more swiftly from the parted skies.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>When the huge bird his pinions long had plied,
In a straight line, without one stoop or bend,
He, tired of air, with sweeping wheel and wide,
Began upon an island to descend;
Like that fair region, whither, long unspied
Of him, her wayward mood did long offend,
Whilom in vain, through strange and secret sluice,
Passed under sea the Virgin Arethuse.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>A more delightful place, wherever hurled
Through the whole air, Rogero had not found:
And, had he ranged the universal world,
Would not have seen a lovelier in his round,
Than that, where, wheeling wide, the courser furled
His spreading wings, and lighted on the ground,
&#39;Mid cultivated plain, delicious hill,
Moist meadow, shady bank, and crystal rill.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Small thickets, with the scented laurel gay,
Cedar, and orange, full of fruit and flower,
Myrtle and palm, with interwoven spray,
Pleached in mixed modes, all lovely, form a bower;
And, breaking with their shade the scorching ray,
Make a cool shelter from the noontide hour.
And nightingales among those branches wing
Their flight, and safely amorous descants sing.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Amid red roses and white lilies there,
Which the soft breezes freshen as they fly,
Secure the cony haunts, and timid hare,
And stag, with branching forehead broad and high.
These, fearless of the hunter&#39;s dart or snare,
Feed at their ease, or ruminating lie:
While, swarming in those wilds, from tuft or steep
Dun deer or nimble goat, disporting, leap.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>When the hyppogryph above the island hung,
And had approached so nigh that landscape fair,
That, if his rider from the saddle sprung,
He might the leap with little danger dare,
Rogero lit the grass and flowers among,
But held him, lest he should remount the air:
And to a myrtle, nigh the rolling brine,
Made fast, between a bay-tree and a pine.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And there, close-by where rose a bubbling fount,
Begirt the fertile palm and cedar-tree,
He drops the shield, the helmet from his front
Uplifts, and, either hand from gauntlet free,
Now turning to the beach, and now the mount,
Catches the gales which blow from hill or sea,
And, with a joyous murmur, lightly stir
The lofty top of beech, or feathery fir:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And, now, to bathe his burning lips he strains;
Now dabbles in the crystal wave, to chase
The scorching heat which rages in his veins,
Caught from the heavy corslet&#39;s burning case.
Nor is it marvel if the burden pains;
No ramble his in square or market-place!
Three thousand miles, without repose, he went,
And still, at speed, in ponderous armour pent.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Meanwhile the courser by the myrtle&#39;s side,
Whom he left stabled in the cool retreat,
Started at something in the wood descried,
Scared by I know not what; and in his heat
So made the myrtle shake where he was tied,
He brought a shower of leaves about his feet;
He made the myrtle shake and foliage fall,
But, struggling, could not loose himself withal.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>As in a stick to feed the chimney rent,
Where scanty pith ill fills the narrow sheath,
The vapour, in its little channel pent,
Struggles, tormented by the fire beneath;
And, till its prisoned fury find a vent,
Is heard to hiss and bubble, sing and seethe:
So the offended myrtle inly pined,
Groaned, murmured, and at last unclosed its rind:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And hence a clear, intelligible speech
Thus issued, with a melancholy sound;
&quot;If, as thy cheer and gentle presence teach,
Thou courteous art and good, his reign unbound,
Release me from this monster, I beseech:
Griefs of my own inflict sufficient wound:
Nor need I, compassed with such ills about,
Other new pain to plague me from without.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>At the first sound, Rogero turns to see
Whence came the voice, and, in unused surprise,
Stands, when he finds it issues from the tree;
And swiftly to remove the courser hies.
Then, with a face suffused with crimson, he
In answer to the groaning myrtle, cries;
&quot;Pardon! and, whatsoe&#39;er thou art, be good,
Spirit of man, or goddess of the wood!</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Unweeting of the wonderous prodigy
Of spirit, pent beneath the knotty rind,
To your fair leaf and living body I
Have done this scathe and outrage undesigned.
But not the less for that, to me reply,
What art thou, who, in rugged case confined,
Dost live and speak?  And so may never hail
From angry heaven your gentle boughs assail!</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;And if I now or ever the despite
I did thee can repair, or aid impart,
I, by that lady dear, my promise plight,
Who in her keeping has my better part,
To strive with word and deed, till thou requite
The service done with praise and grateful heart.&quot;
Rogero said; and, as he closed his suit,
That gentle myrtle shook from top to root.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Next drops were seen to stand upon the bark,
As juice is sweated by the sapling-spray,
New-severed, when it yields to flame and spark,
Sometime in vain kept back and held at bay.
And next the voice began:  &quot;My story dark,
Forced by thy courteous deed, I shall display; —
What once I was — by whom, through magic lore,
Changed to a myrtle on the pleasant shore.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;A peer of France, Astolpho was my name,
Whilom a paladin, sore feared in fight;
Cousin I was to two of boundless fame,
Orlando and Rinaldo.  I by right
Looked to all England&#39;s crown; my lawful claim
After my royal father, Otho hight.
More dames than one my beauty served to warm,
And in conclusion wrought my single harm.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Returning from those isles, whose eastern side
The billows of the Indian ocean beat,
Where good Rinaldo and more knights beside
With me were pent in dark and hollow seat,
Thence, rescued by illustrious Brava&#39;s pride,
Whose prowess freed us from that dark retreat,
Westward I fared along the sandy shores,
On which the stormy north his fury pours.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Pursuing thus our rugged journey, we
Came (such our evil doom upon the strand, ) 

Where stood a mansion seated by the sea:
Puissant Alcina owned the house and land.
We found her, where, without her dwelling, she
Had taken on the beach her lonely stand;
And though nor hook nor sweeping net she bore,
What fish she willed, at pleasure drew to shore.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Thither swift dolphins gambol, inly stirred,
And open-mouthed the cumbrous tunnies leap;
Thither the seal or porpus&#39; wallowing herd
Troop at her bidding, roused from lazy sleep;
Raven-fish, salmon, salpouth, at her word,
And mullet hurry through the briny deep,
With monstrous backs above the water, sail
Ork, physeter, sea-serpent, shark, and whale.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;There we behold a mighty whale, of size
The hugest yet in any water seen:
More than eleven paces, to our eyes,
His back appears above the surface green:
And (for still firm and motionless he lies,
And such the distance his two ends between)
We all are cheated by the floating pile,
And idly take the monster for an isle.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Alcina made the ready fish obey
By simple words and by mere magic lore:
Born with Morgana — but I cannot say
If at one birth, or after or before.
As soon as seen, my aspect pleased the fay;
Who showed it in the countenance she wore:
Then wrought with art, and compassed her intent,
To part me from the friends with whom I went.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;She came towards us with a cheerful face,
With graceful gestures, and a courteous air,
And said:  &#39;So you my lodging please to grace,
Sir cavalier, and will with me repair,
You shall behold the wonders of my chace,
And note the different sorts of fish I snare;
Shaggy or smooth, or clad in scales of light,
And more in number than the stars of night:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XL</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot; &#39;And would you hear a mermaid sing so sweet,
That the rude sea grows civil at her song,
Wont at this hour her music to repeat,
(With that she showed the monster huge and long
— I said it seemed an island — as her seat)
Pass with me where she sings the shoals among.&#39;
I, that was always wilful, at her wish,
I now lament my rashness, climb the fish.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;To Dudon and Rinaldo&#39;s signal blind,
I go, who warn me to misdoubt the fay.
With laughing face Alcina mounts behind,
Leaving the other two beside the bay.
The obedient fish performs the task assigned,
And through the yielding water works his way.
Repentant of my deed, I curse the snare,
Too far from land my folly to repair.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;To aid me swam Mount Alban&#39;s cavalier,
And was nigh drowned amid the waves that rise;
For a south-wind sprang up that, far and near,
Covered with sudden darkness seas and skies.
I know not after what befel the peer:
This while Alcina to console me tries,
And all that day, and night which followed, me
Detained upon that monster in mid-sea,</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Till to this isle we drifted with the morn,
Of which Alcina keeps a mighty share;
By that usurper from a sister torn,
Who was her father&#39;s universal heir:
For that she only was in wedlock born,
And for those other two false sisters were
(So well-instructed in the story, said
One who rehearsed the tale in incest bred. ) 
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;As these are practised in iniquity,
And full of every vice and evil art;
So she, who ever lives in chastity,
Wisely on better things has set her heart.
Hence, leagued against her, in conspiracy,
Those others are, to drive her from her part:
And more than once their armies have o&#39;errun
Her realm, and towns above a hundred won.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Nor at this hour a single span of ground
Would Logistilla (such her name command, ) 

But that a mountain here, and there a sound,

England, and part it from the Scottish land.
Yet will the sisters give their foe no rest,
Till of her scanty remnant dispossest.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVI</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Because in wickedness and vice were bred
The pair, as chaste and good they loath the dame.
But, to return to what I lately said,
And to relate how I a plant became;
Me, full of love, the kind Alcina fed
With full delights; nor I a weaker flame
For her, within my burning heart did bear,
Beholding her so courteous and so fair.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVII</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Clasped in her dainty limbs, and lapt in pleasure,
I weened that I each separate good had won,
Which to mankind is dealt in different measure,
Little or more to some, and much to none.
I evermore contemplated my treasure,

In her my every fancy, every hope
Centered and ended as their common scope.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVIII</p>

<pre><code>&quot;By her I was as much beloved, or more;
Nor did Alcina now for other care;
She left her every lover; for before,
Others, in truth, the fairy&#39;s love did share:
I was her close adviser evermore;
And served by her, where they commanded were.
With me she counselled, and to me referred;
Nor, night nor day, to other spake a word.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIX</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Why touch my wounds, to aggravate my ill,
And that, alas!  without the hope of cure?
Why thus the good possessed remember still,
Amid the cruel penance I endure?
When kindest I believed Alcina&#39;s will,
And fondly deemed my happiness secure,
From me the heart she gave, the fay withdrew,
And yielded all her soul to love more new.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>L</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Late I discerned her light and fickle bent,
Still loving and unloving at a heat:
Two months, I reigned not more, no sooner spent,
Than a new paramour assumed my seat;
And me, with scorn, she doomed to banishment,
From her fair grace cast out.  &#39;Tis then I weet
I share a thousand lovers&#39; fate, whom she
Had to like pass reduced, all wrongfully.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LI</p>

<pre><code>&quot;And these, because they should not scatter bruits,
Roaming the world, of her lascivious ways,
She, up and down the fruitful soil, transmutes
To olive, palm, or cedar, firs or bays.

While this transformed into a monster strays;
Another melts into a liquid rill;
As suits that haughty fairy&#39;s wanton will.</code></pre><blockquote>

Have from Alcina seigniory and throne;

Transformed to beast or fountain, plant or rock.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>The good Rogero, who from Fame had learned
That he was cousin to the dame he wooed,
Lamented much the sad Astolpho, turned
From his true form, to barren plant and rude:

But, witless how to give the wished relief,
Might but console the unhappy warrior&#39;s grief.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>As best he could, he strove to soothe his pain;
Then asked him, if to Logistil&#39;s retreat
Were passage, whether over hill or plain;
That he might so eschew Alcina&#39;s seat.

Would scale the Alpine mountain&#39;s very height:</code></pre><blockquote>

Departed thence with full instructions fraught.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>The courser from the myrtle he untied,
And by the bridle led behind him still;
Nor would he, as before, the horse bestride,

A passage to the land of Logistil;
Firm in his purpose every nerve to strain,
Lest empire over him Alcina gain.</code></pre><blockquote>

Rogero said; (but the resolve was vain)
Nor by the beach two miles his way pursued,
Ere he Alcina&#39;s lovely city viewed.</code></pre><blockquote>

Which girds a spacious town within its bound;
It seems as if its summit touched the sky,

And haply he more wittily divines:
For me, I deem it gold because it shines.</code></pre><blockquote>

Strains now against the mountain; but, in wait,
Encounters soon the crowd of evil foes,
Who furiously the Child&#39;s advance oppose.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Was never yet beheld a stranger band,
Of mien more hideous, or more monstrous shape.
Formed downwards from neck like men, he scanned
Some with the head of cat, and some of ape;
With hoof of goat that other stamped the sand;

Naked, or mantled in outlandish skin.
These doting sires, those striplings bold in sin.</code></pre><blockquote>

These drain the cup and those the bungle blow.

One a dull file, or bar of iron shook.</code></pre><blockquote>

Appeared, with monstrous paunch and bloated face;
Who a slow tortoise for a horse bestrode,

For he was drunk, and kept him in his place.
Some wipe his brows and chin from sweat which ran,
And others with their vests his visage fan.</code></pre><blockquote>

In mail, his brows with covering helmet dressed,
Or fought, secured by corslet or by shield;
Yet is he so upon all quarters pressed,

And to keep off the wicked crew which swarms,
More than Briareus&#39; hundred hands and arms.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>This as it may: the Child would meet his fate,
Ere by so vile a band be prisoner led;
When, lo!  forth issuing from the city&#39;s gate,
Whose wall appeared like shining gold I said,
Two youthful dames, not born in low estate,
If measured by their mien and garb, nor bred
By swain, in early wants and troubles versed;
But amid princely joys in palace nursed!</code></pre><blockquote>

A beast than spotless ermine yet more white;

Would need a surer sense than mortal sight,
To judge between the two.  With such a mien
Embodied Grace and Beauty would be seen.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Into the mead rode this and the other dame,
Where the foul crew opposed the Child&#39;s retreat.
The rabble scattered as the ladies came,

Thanked the two damsels for their gentle feat;
And was content upon their will to wait,
With them returning to that golden gate.</code></pre><blockquote>

On columns of one solid diamond made.

With many proffers and fair mien entice,
And welcome to this opening Paradise:</code></pre><blockquote>

Nor finds a place in any bosom.  Dearth,
Nor yet Discomfort, never enter here,
Where Plenty fills her horn throughout the year.</code></pre><blockquote>

In dance, or no mean sport the hours beguile.
While this, who shuns the revellers&#39; noisy cheer,
Tells his love sorrows in his comrade&#39;s ear.</code></pre><blockquote>

At hearts, and those spread nets to catch their prey;
One wets his arrows in the brook which winds,
And one on whirling stone the weapon grinds.</code></pre><blockquote>

To the other shore, a giantess in frame;
Who has long poisonous teeth her prey to tear,
And scratches with her talons like a bear.</code></pre><blockquote>

But to afford my aid to others due;
And, most of all, to beauteous dames like you.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Rogero, as directed by the pair,
The giantess Eriphila o&#39;erthrows.
That done, he to Alcina&#39;s labyrinth, where
More than one knight is tied and prisoned, goes.
To him Melissa sage the secret snare,
And remedy for that grave evil shows.
Whence he, by her advised, with downcast eye,
And full of shame forthwith resolves to fly.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>I</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The traveller, he, whom sea or mountain sunder
From his own country, sees things strange and new;
That the misjudging vulgar, which lies under
The mist of ignorance, esteems untrue:
Rejecting whatsoever is a wonder,
Unless &#39;tis palpable and plain to view:
Hence inexperience, as I know full well,
Will yield small credence to the tale I tell.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>II</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But this be great or small, I know not why
The rabble&#39;s silly judgement I should fear,
Convinced you will not think the tale a lie,
In whom the light of reason shines so clear.
And hence to you it is I only try
The fruit of my fatigues to render dear.
I ended where Eriphila in guard
Of bridge and stream was seen, the passage barred.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>III</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Of finest metal was her armour bright,
With gems of many colours overspread,
The tawny jacinth, yellow chyrsolite,
The emerald green of hue, and ruby red.
Mounted, but not on palfrey, for the fight:
In place of that, she on a wolf had sped,
Sped on a wolf towards the pass; and rode
On sell, that rich beyond all custom showed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>No larger wolf, I ween, Apulia roams;
More huge than bull, unguided by her hand;
Although upon no bit the monster foams,
Docile, I know not why, to her command.
The accursed Plague, arrayed in surcoat, comes
Above her arms, in colour like the sand;
That, saving in its dye, was of the sort
Which bishops and which prelates wear at court.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>V</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The giantess&#39;s crest and shield appear,
For ensign, decked with swoln and poisonous toad.
Her the two damsels to the cavalier
Before the bridge, prepared for battle, showed,
Threatening, as wont to some, with levelled spear,
To do the warrior scorn and bar the road.
Bidding him turn, she to Rogero cries;
A lance he takes, and threats her and defies.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>As quick and daring, the gigantic Pest
Spurred her wolf, seated well for that dread game:
In mid career she laid her lance in rest,
And made earth quake beneath her as she came;
Yet at the encounter fierce the champaign pressed;
For underneath the casque, with stedfast aim,
So hard Rogero smote her, that he bore
The beldam backward six good yards and more:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And came already with his lifted blade,
Drawn for that end, to take her haughty head;
To him an easy task; for she was laid
Among the grass and flowers, like one that&#39;s dead.
But, &quot; &#39;Tis enough that she is vanquished,&quot; said
The pair, &quot;No further press thy vengeance dread.
Sheathe, courteous cavalier, thy sword anew:
Pass we the river, and our way pursue.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VIII</p>

<pre><code>Along the path, which through a forest lay,
Roughish and somedeal ill to beat, they went.
Besides that strait and stony was the way,
This, nigh directly, scaled a hill&#39;s ascent.
But, when arrived upon the summit, they
Issued upon a mead of vast extent;
And a more pleasant palace on that green
Beheld, and brighter than was ever seen.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IX</p>

<pre><code>To meet the Child, Alcina, fair of hue,
Advanced some way beyond the outer gate;
And, girded by a gay and courtly crew,
Rogero there received in lordly state:
While all the rest to him such honour do,
And on the knight with such deep reverence wait,
They could not have displayed more zeal and love,
Had Jove descended from the choirs above.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>X</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Not so much does the palace, fair to see,
In riches other princely domes excel,
As that the gentlest, fairest, company
Which the whole world contains, within it dwell:
Of either sex, with small variety
Between, in youth and beauty matched as well:
The fay alone exceeds the rest as far
As the bright sun outshines each lesser star.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Her shape is of such perfect symmetry,
As best to feign the industrious painter knows,
With long and knotted tresses; to the eye
Not yellow gold with brighter lustre glows.
Upon her tender cheek the mingled dye
Is scattered, of the lily and the rose.
Like ivory smooth, the forehead gay and round
Fills up the space, and forms a fitting bound.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Two black and slender arches rise above
Two clear black eyes, say suns of radiant light,
Which ever softly beam and slowly move;
Round these appears to sport in frolic flight,
Hence scattering all his shafts, the little Love,
And seems to plunder hearts in open sight.
Thence, through mid visage, does the nose descend,
Where Envy finds not blemish to amend.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>As if between two vales, which softly curl,
The mouth with vermeil tint is seen to glow:
Within are strung two rows of orient pearl,
Which her delicious lips shut up or show.
Of force to melt the heart of any churl,
However rude, hence courteous accents flow:
And here that gentle smile receives its birth,
Which opes at will a paradise on earth.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Like milk the bosom, and the neck of snow;
Round is the neck, and full and large the breast;
Where, fresh and firm, two ivory apples grow,
Which rise and fall, as, to the margin pressed
By pleasant breeze, the billows come and go.
Not prying Argus could discern the rest.
Yet might the observing eye of things concealed
Conjecture safely, from the charms revealed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To all her arms a just proportion bear,
And a white hand is oftentimes descried,
Which narrow is, and somedeal long; and where
No knot appears, nor vein is signified.
For finish of that stately shape and rare,
A foot, neat, short, and round, beneath is spied.
Angelic visions, creatures of the sky,
Concealed beneath no covering veil can lie.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>A springe is planted in Rogero&#39;s way,
On all sides did she speak, smile, sing, or move;
No wonder then the stripling was her prey,
Who in the fairy saw such show of love.
With him the guilt and falsehood little weigh,
Of which the offended myrtle told above.
Nor will he think that perfidy and guile
Can be united with so sweet a smile.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>No!  he could now believe, by magic art,
Astolpho well transformed upon the plain,
For punishment of foul ungrateful heart,
And haply meriting severer pain.
And, as for all he heard him late impart,
&#39;Twas prompted by revenge, &#39;twas false and vain.
By hate and malice was the sufferer stung,
To blame and wound the fay with slanderous tongue.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The beauteous lady whom he loved so well
Is newly banished from his altered breast;
For (such the magic of Alcina&#39;s spell)
She every ancient passion dispossessed;
And in his bosom, there alone to dwell,
The image of her love, and self impressed.
So witched, Rogero sure some grace deserves,
If from his faith his frail affection swerves.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIX</p>

<pre><code>At board lyre, lute and harp of tuneful string,
And other sounds, in mixed diversity,
Made, round about, the joyous palace ring,
With glorious concert and sweet harmony.
Nor lacked there well-accorded voice to sing
Of love, its passion and its ecstasy;
Nor who, with rare inventions, choicely versed,
Delightful fiction to the guests rehearsed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>What table, spread by whatsoever heir
Of Ninus, though triumphant were the board,
Or what more famous and more costly, where
Cleopatra feasted with the Latian lord,
Could with this banquet&#39;s matchless joys compare,
By the fond fairy for Rogero stored?
I think not such a feast is spread above,
Where Ganymede presents the cup to Jove.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>They form a ring, the board and festive cheer
Removed, and sitting, play a merry game:
Each asks, still whispering in a neighbour&#39;s ear,
What secret pleases best; to knight and dame
A fair occasion, without let or fear,
Their love, unheard of any, to proclaim.
And in conclusion the two lovers plight
Their word, to meet together on that night.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Soon, and much sooner than their wont, was ended
The game at which the palace inmates play:
When pages on the troop with torches tended,
And with their radiance chased the night away.
To seek his bed the paladin ascended,
Girt with that goodly squadron, in a gay
And airy bower, appointed for his rest,
Mid all the others chosen as the best.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And when of comfits and of cordial wine
A fitting proffer has been made anew,
The guests their bodies reverently incline,
And to their bowers depart the courtly crew.
He upon perfumed sheets, whose texture fine
Seemed of Arachne&#39;s loom, his body threw:
Hearkening this while with still attentive ears,
If he the coming of the lady hears.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>At every movement heard on distant floor,
Hoping &#39;twas her, Rogero raised his head:
He thinks he hears; but it is heard no more,
Then sighs at his mistake: ofttimes from bed
He issued, and undid his chamber door,
And peeped abroad, but still no better sped;
And cursed a thousand times the hour that she
So long retarded his felicity.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Yes, now she comes,&quot; the stripling often said,
And reckoned up the paces, as he lay,
Which from her bower where haply to be made
To that where he was waiting for the fay.
These thoughts, and other thoughts as vain, he weighed
Before she came, and restless at her stay,
Often believed some hinderance, yet unscanned,
Might interpose between the fruit and hand.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>At length, when dropping sweets the costly fay
Had put some end to her perfumery,
The time now come she need no more delay,
Since all was hushed within the palace, she
Stole from her bower alone, through secret way,
And passed towards the chamber silently,
Where on his couch the youthful cavalier
Lay, with a heart long torn by Hope and Fear.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>When the successor of Astolpho spies
Those smiling stars above him, at the sight
A flame, like that of kindled sulphur, flies
Through his full veins, as ravished by delight
Out of himself; and now up to the eyes
Plunged in a sea of bliss, he swims outright.
He leaps from bed and folds her to his breast,
Nor waits until the lady he undressed;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Though but in a light sendal clad, that she
Wore in the place of farthingale or gown;
Which o&#39;er a shift of finest quality,
And white, about her limbs the fay had thrown:
The mantle yielded at his touch, as he
Embraced her, and that veil remained alone,
Which upon every side the damsel shows,
More than clear glass the lily or the rose.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The plant no closer does the ivy clip,
With whose green boughs its stem is interlaced.
Than those fond lovers, each from either&#39;s lip
The balmy breath collecting, he embraced:
Rich perfume this, whose like no seed or slip
Bears in sweet Indian or Sabacan waste;
While so to speak their joys is either fixed,
That oftentimes those meeting lips are mixed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>These things were carried closely by the dame
And youth, or if surmised, were never bruited;
For silence seldom was a cause for blame,
But oftener as a virtue well reputed.
By those shrewd courtiers, conscious of his claim,
Rogero is with proffers fair saluted:
Worshipped of all those inmates, who fulfil
In this the enamoured far, Alcina&#39;s will.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>No pleasure is omitted there; since they
Alike are prisoners in Love&#39;s magic hall.
They change their raiment twice or thrice a day,
Now for this use, and now at other call.
&#39;Tis often feast, and always holiday;
&#39;Tis wrestling, tourney, pageant, bath, and ball.
Now underneath a hill by fountain cast,
They read the amorous lays of ages past:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Now by glad hill, or through the shady dale,
They hunt the fearful hare, and now they flush
With busy dog, sagacious of the trail,
Wild pheasant from the stubble-field or bush.
Now where green junipers perfume the gale,
Suspend the snare, or lime the fluttering thrush:
And casting now for fish, with net or book,
Disturb their secret haunts in pleasant brook.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Rogero revels there, in like delight,
While Charles and Agramant are troubled sore.
But not for him their story will I slight,
Nor Bradamant forget: who evermore,
Mid toilsome pain and care, her cherished knight,
Ravished from her, did many a day deplore;
Whom by unwonted ways, transported through
Mid air, the damsel saw, nor whither knew.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIV</p>

<pre><code>Of her I speak before the royal pair,
Who many days pursued her search in vain;
By shadowy wood, or over champaign bare,
By farm and city, and by hill and plain;

Divided by such space of land and main:
Often she goes among the Paynim spears,
Yet never aught of her Rogero hears.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Of hundreds questioned, upon every side,
Each day, no answer ever gives content.
She roams from post to post, and far and wide
Searches pavilion, lodging, booth, or rent,
And this, mid foot or horsemen, unespied,
May safely do, without impediment,
Thanks to the ring, whose more than mortal aid,
When in her mouth, conceals the vanished maid.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVI</p>

<pre><code>She cannot, will not, think that he is dead;
Because the wreck of such a noble knight
Would, from Hydaspes&#39; distant waves have spread,
To where the sun descends with westering light.
She knows not what to think, nor whither sped,
He roams in earth or air; yet, hapless wight,
Him ever seeks, and for attendant train
Has sobs and sighs, and every bitter pain.</code></pre><blockquote>

Where the prophetic homes of Merlin lie,
And there lament herself until she wrought
Upon the pitying marble to reply;

Of this glad life to hard necessity
Had yielded up; and, when she was possessed
Of the seer&#39;s councils, would pursue the best.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>With this intention, Bradamant her way
Directed thither, where in Poictier&#39;s wood
The vocal tomb, containing Merlin&#39;s clay,
Concealed in Alpine place and savage, stood.

Thought of the damsel, watchful for her good,
She, I repeat, who taught her what should be
In that fair grotto her posterity;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>She who preserved her with protecting care,
That same enchantress, still benign and wise,
Who, knowing she a matchless race should bear
Of men, or rather semi-deities,
Spies daily what her thoughts and actions are,
And lots for her each day, divining, tries; —
She all Rogero&#39;s fortune knew, how freed;
Then borne to India by the griffin steed:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XL</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Him on that courser plainly she had eyed,
Who would not the controlling rein obey;
When, severed by such interval, he hied,
Borne through the perilous, unwonted way:
And knew that he sport, dance, and banquet plied,
And lapt in idleness and pleasure lay;
Nor memory of his lord nor of the dame,
Once loved so well, preserved, not of his fame.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And thus such gentle knight ingloriously
Would have consumed his fairest years and best,
In long inaction, afterwards to be,
Body and soul, destroyed; and that, possessed
Alone by us in perpetuity.
That flower, whose sweets outlive the fragile rest
Which quickens man when he in earth is laid,
Would have been plucked or severed in the blade.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But that enchantress kind, who with more care
Than for himself he watched, still kept the knight,
Designed to drag him, by rough road and bare,
Towards true virtue, in his own despite;
As often cunning leech will burn and pare
The flesh, and poisonous drug employ aright:
Who, though at first his cruel art offend,
Is thanked, since he preserves us in the end.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>She, not like old Atlantes, rendered blind
By the great love she to the stripling bore,
Set not on gifting him with life her mind,
As was the scope of that enchanter hoar;
Who, reckless all of fame and praise declined,
Wished length of days to his Rogero more
Than that, to win a world&#39;s applause, the peer
Should of his joyous life forego one year.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>By him he to Alcina&#39;s isle had been
Dispatched, that in her palace he might dwell,
Forgetting arms; and, as enchanter seen
In magic and the use of every spell,
The heart had fastened of that fairy-queen,
Enamoured of the gentle youth, so well,
That she the knot would never disengage,
Though he should live to more than Nestor&#39;s age.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Returning now to her that well foreknew
Whatever was to come to pass, I say
She thither did her journey straight pursue,
Where she met Aymon&#39;s daughter by the way
Forlorn and wandering: Bradamant at view
Of her enchantress, erst to grief a prey,
Changes it all to hope: the other tells
That with Alcina her Rogero dwells.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Nigh dead the maid remains, in piteous guise,
Hearing of him so far removed, and more
Grieves that she danger to her love descries,
Save this some strong and speedy cure restore.
But her the enchantress comforts, and applies
A salve where it was needed most, and swore
That few short days should pass before anew
Rogero should return to glad her view.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Since thou, an antidote to sorcery,
Lady (she said), the virtuous ring dost wear,
I have no doubt if to yon island I
This, where thine every good is hidden, hear,
To foil Alcina&#39;s wiles and witchery,
And thence to bring thee back thy cherished care.
This evening, early, will I hence away,
And be in India by the break of day.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And told to her, the tale continuing,
The mode which she was purposing to employ,
From that effeminate, soft realm to bring
Back into warlike France the cherished boy.
Bradamant from her finger slipt the ring,
Nor this alone would have bestowed with joy;
But heart and life would at her feet have laid,
If she had deemed they could Rogero aid.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Giving the ring, her cause she recommends
To her, and recommends Rogero more.
Countless salutes by her the damsel sends,
Then of Provence, departing seeks the shore.
The enchantress to another quarter wends;
And, for the execution of her lore,
Conjures, that eve, a palfrey, by her art,
With one foot red, black every other part.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>L</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Some Farfarello, or Alchino he,
I think, whom in that form she raised from hell;
And with loose hair, dishevelled horribly,
Ungirt and barefoot, mounted in the sell.
But, with wise caution, from her finger she
Withdrew the ring, lest it should mar the spell:
And then by him was with such swiftness born,
She in Alcina&#39;s isle arrived at morn.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Herself she changed with wonderful disguise,
Adding a palm of stature to her height;
And made her limbs of a proportioned size;
And of the very measure seemed to sight,
As was she deemed, the necromancer wise,
Who with such care had reared the youthful knight.
With long-descending beard she clothed her chin,
And wrinkled o&#39;er her front and other skin.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To imitate his speech, and face, and cheer,
She knew so well, that, by the youth descried,
She might the sage Atlantes&#39; self appear;
Next hid, and watched so long, that she espied
Upon a day (rare chance the cavalier ) 

At length detached from his Alcina&#39;s side:
For still, in motion or at rest, the fay
Ill bore the youth should be an hour away.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Alone she finds him, fitting well her will,
As he enjoys the pure and morning air
Beside a brook, which trickled from a hill,
Streaming towards a limpid lake and fair.
His fine, soft garments, wove with cunning skill,
All over, ease and wantonness declare;
These with her hand, such subtle toil well taught,
For him in silk and gold Alcina wrought.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>About the stripling&#39;s neck, a splendid string
Of gems, descending to mid-breast, is wound;
On each once manly arm, now glittering
With the bright hoop, a bracelet fair is bound.
Pierced with golden wire, in form of ring,
Is either ear; and from the yellow round
Depend two precious pearls; not such the coast
Of Araby or sumptuous India boast.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Crisped into comely ringlets was his hair,
Wet with the costliest odours and the best;
And soft and amorous all his gestures were,
Like one who does Valentian lady&#39;s hest.
In him, beside his name, was nothing fair,
And more than half corrupted all the rest.
So was Rogero found, within that dell,
Changed from his former self by potent spell.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Him in the figure of Atlantes sage
She fronts, who bore the enchanter&#39;s borrowed cheer;
With that grave face, and reverend with age,
Which he was always wonted to revere;
And with that eye, which in his pupillage,
Beaming with wrath, he whilom so did fear.
And sternly cries, &quot;Is this the fruit at last
Which pays my tedious pain and labour past?</code></pre><blockquote>

That, bred in such a school, in thee should I
Alcina&#39;s Atys or Adonis spy?</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>&quot;Is this the hope that stars, observed by me,
Signs in conjunction, sacred fibres, bred;
With what beside of dream or augury,

Thy fears should so be bruited far and near,
Thou justly should be deemed without a peer?</code></pre><blockquote>

Without disguise, and in her real dress,
This ring, returning, on thy finger wear,
And thou shalt see the dame, and mark how fair.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Abashed and mute, Rogero, listening,
In vain to her reproof an answer sought:
Who on his little finger put the ring,
Whose virtue to himself the warrior brought.
And such remorse and shame within him spring,
When on his altered sense the change is wrought,
A thousand fathoms deep he fain would lie
Buried in earth, unseen of any eye.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>So speaking, to the natural shape she wore
Before his eyes returned the magic dame;
Nor old Atlantes&#39; form was needed more,
The good effect obtained for which she came.
To tell you that which was not told before,
Melissa was the sage enchantress&#39; name:
Who to Rogero now her purpose said,
And told with what design she thither sped:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Dispatched by her, who him in anxious pain
Desires, nor longer can without him be,
With the intent to loose him from the chain
Wherewith he was begirt by sorcery;
And had put on, more credence to obtain,
Atlantes de Carena&#39;s form; but she,
Seeing his health restored, now willed the youth,
Through her should hear and see the very truth.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;That gentle lady who so loves thee, who
Were well deserving love upon thy part;
To whom (unless forgot, thou know&#39;st how true
The tale thou debtor for thy freedom art, ) 

This ring, which can each magic spell undo,
Sends for thy succour, and would send her heart,
If with such virtue fraught, her heart could bring
Thee safely in thy perils, like the ring.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>How Bradamant had loved, and loves, she says,
Continuing to Rogero her relation;
To this, her worth commends with fitting praise,
Tempering in truth and fondness her narration;
And still employs the choicest mode and phrase,
Which fits one skilful in negociation,
And on the false Alcina brings such hate,
As on things horrible is wont to wait;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Brings hate on that which he so loved before;
Nor let the tale astonish which you hear,
For since his love was forced by magic lore,
The ring the false enchantment served to clear.
This too unmasked the charms Alcina wore,
And made all false, from head to food, appear.
None of her own, but borrowed, all he sees,
And the once sparkling cup now drugged with lees.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Like boy who somewhere his ripe fruit bestows,
And next forgets the place where it is laid,
Then, after many days, conducted goes
By chance, where he the rich deposit made,
And wonders that the hidden treasure shows,
Not what it is, but rotten and decayed;
And hates, and scorns, and loathes, with altered eyes,
And throws away what he was used to prize.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Rogero thus, when by Melissa&#39;s lore
Advised, he to behold the fay returned,
And that good ring of sovereign virtue wore,
Which, on the finger placed, all spells o&#39;erturned;
For that fair damsel he had left before,
To his surprise, so foul a dame discerned,
That in this ample world, examined round,
A hag so old and hideous is not found.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Pale, lean, and wrinkled was the face, and white,
And thinly clothed with hair Alcina&#39;s head;
Her stature reached not to six palms in height,
And every tooth was gone; for she had led
A longer life than ever mortal wight,
Than Hecuba or she in Cuma bred;
But thus by practice, to our age unknown,
Appeared with youth and beauty not her own.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>By art she gave herself the lovely look,
Which had on many like Rogero wrought;
But now the ring interpreted the book,
Which secrets, hid for many ages, taught.
No wonder then that he the dame forsook,
And banished from his mind all further thought
Of love for false Alcina, found in guise
Which no new means of slippery fraud supplies.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But, as Melissa counselled him, he wore
His wonted semblance for a time, till he
Was with his armour, many days before
Laid by, again accoutred cap-a-pee.
And, lest Alcina should his end explore,
Feigned to make proof of his agility;
Feigned to make proof if for his arms he were
Too gross, long time unwont the mail to bear.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Next Balisarda to his flank he tied
(For so Rogero&#39;s trenchant sword was hight),
And took the wondrous buckler, which, espied,
Not only dazzled the beholder&#39;s sight,
But seemed, when its silk veil was drawn aside,
As from the body if exhaled the sprite:
In its close cover of red sendal hung,
This at his neck the youthful warrior slung.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Provided thus, he to the stables came,
And bade with bridle and with saddle dight
A horse more black than pitch; for so the dame
Counselled, well-taught how swift the steed and light.
Him Rabicano those who know him name,
And he the courser was, that with the knight,
Who stands beside the sea, the breeze&#39;s sport,
The whale of yore conducted to that port.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The hippogryph he might have had at need,
Who next below good Rabican was tied,
But that the dame had cried to him, &quot;Take heed,
Thou know&#39;st how ill that courser is to ride&quot;;
And said the following day the winged steed
&#39;Twas her intention from that realm to guide,
Where he should be instructed at his leisure,
To rein and run him every where at pleasure:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Nor, if he took him not, would he suggest
Suspicion of the intended flight: The peer
This while performed Melissa&#39;s every hest,
Who, still invisible, was at his ear.
So feigning, from the wanton dome possessed
By that old strumpet, rode the cavalier;
And pricking forth drew near unto a gate,
Whence the road led to Logistilla&#39;s state.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Assaulting suddenly the guardian crew,
He, sword in hand, the squadron set upon;
This one he wounded, and that other slew,
And, point by point made good, the drawbridge won:
And ere of his escape Alcina knew,
The gentle youth was far away and gone.
My next shall tell his route, and how he gained
At last the realm where Logistilla reigned.</code></pre><hr>
<h4>Canto 8</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>ARGUMENT</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Rogero flies; Astolpho with the rest,
To their true shape Melissa does restore;
Rinaldo levies knights and squadrons, pressed
In aid of Charles assaulted by the Moor:
Angelica, by ruffians found at rest,
Is offered to a monster on the shore.
Orlando, warned in visions of his ill,
Departs from Paris sore against his will.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>I</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>How many enchantresses among us!  oh,
How many enchanters are there, though unknown!
Who for their love make man or woman glow,
Changing them into figures not their own.
Nor this by help of spirits from below,
Nor observation of the stars is done:
But these on hearts with fraud and falsehood plot,
Binding them with indissoluble knot.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>II</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Who with Angelica&#39;s, or rather who
Were fortified with Reason&#39;s ring, would see
Each countenance, exposed to open view,
Unchanged by art or by hypocrisy.
This now seems fair and good, whose borrowed hue
Removed, would haply foul and evil be.
Well was it for Rogero that he wore
The virtuous ring which served the truth to explore!</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>III</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Rogero, still dissembling, as I said,
Armed, to the gate on Rabican did ride;
Found the guard unprepared, not let his blade,
Amid that crowd, hang idle at his side:
He passed the bridge, and broke the palisade,
Some slain, some maimed; then t&#39;wards the forest hied;
But on that road small space had measured yet,
When he a servant of the fairy met.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He on his fist a ravening falcon bore,
Which he made fly for pastime every day;
Now on the champaign, now upon the shore
Of neighbouring pool, which teemed with certain prey;
And rode a hack which simple housings wore,
His faithful dog, companion of his way.
He, marking well the haste with which he hies,
Conjectures truly what Rogero flies.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>V</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Towards him came the knave, with semblance haught,
Demanding whither in such haste he sped:
To him the good Rogero answers naught.
He hence assured more clearly that he fled,
Within himself to stop the warrior thought,
And thus, with his left arm extended, said:
&quot;What, if I suddenly thy purpose balk,
And thou find no defence against this hawk?&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Then flies his bird, who works so well his wing,
Rabican cannot distance him in flight:
The falconer from his back to ground did spring,
And freed him from the bit which held him tight;
Who seemed an arrow parted from the string,
And terrible to foe, with kick and bite;
While with such haste behind the servant came,
He sped as moved by wind, or rather flame.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Nor will the falconer&#39;s dog appear more slow;
But hunts Rogero&#39;s courser, as in chace
Of timid hare the pard is wont to go.
Not to stand fast the warrior deems disgrace,
And turns towards the swiftly-footed foe,
Whom he sees wield a riding-wand, place
Of other arms, to make his dog obey.
Rogero scorns his faulchion to display.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The servant made at him, and smote him sore;
The dog his left foot worried; while untied
From rein, the lightened horse three times and more
Lashed from the croup, nor missed his better side.
The hawk, oft wheeling, with her talons tore
The stripling, and his horse so terrified,
The courser, by the whizzing sound dismayed,
Little the guiding hand or spur obeyed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Constrained at length, his sword Rogero drew
To clear the rabble, who his course delay;
And in the animals&#39; or villain&#39;s view
Did now its point, and now its edge display.
But with more hinderance and vexatious crew
Swarm here and there, and wholly block the way;
And that dishonour will ensue and loss,
Rogero sees, if him they longer cross.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>X</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He knew each little that he longer stayed,
Would bring the fay and followers on the trail;
Already drums were beat, and trumpets brayed,
And larum-bells rang loud in every vale.
An act too foul it seemed to use his blade
On dog, and knave unfenced with arms or mail:
A better and shorter way it were
The buckler, old Atlantes&#39; work, to bare.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He raised the crimson cloth in which he wore
The wondrous shield, enclosed for many a day;
Its beams, as proved a thousand times before,
Work as they wont, when on the sight they play;
Senseless the falconer tumbles on the moor;
Drop dog and hackney; drop the pinions gay,
Which poised in air the bird no longer keep:
Then glad Rogero leaves a prey to sleep.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>In the mean time, Alcina, who had heard
How he had forced the gate, and, in the press,
Slaughtered a mighty number of her guard,
Remained nigh dead, o&#39;erwhelmed with her distress;
She tore her vesture, and her visage marred,
And cursed her want of wit and wariness.
Then made forthwith her meiny sound to arms,
And round herself arrayed her martial swarms.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Divided next, one squadron by the way
Rogero took, she sent; the bands were two:
She at the port embarked the next array,
And straight to sea dispatched the warlike crew.
With this good squadron went the desperate fay,
And darked by loosened sails the billows grew;
For so desire upon her bosom preyed,
Of troops she left her city unpurveyed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Without a guard she left her palace there,
Which to Melissa, prompt her time to seize,
To loose her vassals that in misery were,
Afforded all convenience and full ease;
— To range, at leisure, through the palace fair,
And so examine all her witcheries;
To raze the seal, burn images, and loose
Or cancel hag-knot, rhomb, or magic noose.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Thence, through the fields, fast hurrying from that dome,
The former lovers changed, a mighty train,
Some into rock or tree, to fountain some,
Or beast, she made assume their shapes again:
And these, when they anew are free to roam,
Follow Rogero&#39;s footsteps to the reign
Of Logistilla&#39;s sage; and from that bourn
To Scythia, Persia, Greece, and Ind return.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>They to their several homes dispatched, repair,
Bound by a debt which never can be paid:
The English duke, above the rest her care,
Of these, was first in human form arrayed:
For much his kindred and the courteous prayer
Of good Rogero with Melissa weighed.
Beside his prayers, the ring Rogero gave;
That him she by its aid might better save.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Thus by Rogero&#39;s suit the enchantress won,
To his first shape transformed the youthful peer;
But good Melissa deemed that nought was done
Save she restored his armour, and that spear
Of gold, which whensoe&#39;er at tilt he run,
At the first touch unseated cavalier;
Once Argalia&#39;s, next Astolpho&#39;s lance,
And source of mighty fame to both in France.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The sage Melissa found this spear of gold,
Which now Alcina&#39;s magic palace graced,
And other armour of the warrior bold,
Of which he was in that ill dome uncased.
She climbed the courser of the wizard old,
And on the croup, at ease, Astolpho placed:
And thus, an hour before Rogero came,
Repaired to Logistilla, knight and dame.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Meantime, through rugged rocks, and shagged with thorn,
Rogero wends, to seek the sober fay;
From cliff to cliff, from path to path forlorn,
A rugged, lone, inhospitable way:
Till he, with labour huge oppressed and worn,
Issued at noon upon a beach, that lay
&#39;Twixt sea and mountain, open to the south,
Deserted, barren, bare, and parched with drouth.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The sunbeams on the neighbouring mountain beat
And glare, reflected from the glowing mass
So fiercely, sand and air both boil with heat,
In mode that might have more than melted glass.
The birds are silent in their dim retreat,
Nor any note is heard in wood or grass,
Save the bough perched Cicala&#39;s wearying cry,
Which deafens hill and dale, and sea and sky.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The heat and thirst and labour which he bore
By that drear sandy way beside the sea,
Along the unhabited and sunny shore,
Were to Rogero grievous company:
Bur for I may not still pursue this lore,
Nor should you busied with one matter be,
Rogero I abandon in this heat,
For Scotland; to pursue Rinaldo&#39;s beat.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>By king, by daughter, and by all degrees,
To Sir Rinaldo was large welcome paid;
And next the warrior, at his better ease,
The occasion of his embassy displayed:
That he from thence and England, subsidies
Of men was seeking, for his monarch&#39;s aid,
In Charles&#39;s name; and added, in his care,
The justest reasons to support his prayer.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The king made answer, that `without delay,
Taxed to the utmost of his powers and might,
His means at Charlemagne&#39;s disposal lay,
For the honour of the empire and the right.
And that, within few days, he in array
Such horsemen, as he had in arms, would dight;
And, save that he was now waxed old, would lead
The expedition he was prayed to speed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>`Nor like consideration would appear
Worthy to stop him, but that he possessed
A son, and for such charge that cavalier,
Measured by wit and force, was worthiest.
Though not within the kingdom was the peer,
It was his hope (as he assured his guest)
He would, while yet preparing was the band,
Return, and find it mustered to his hand.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXV</p>

Who of the loathed Rinaldo has such fear,
She dreads, unless she pass the sea, to die,
As insecure in Europe, far or near,
But she was by the hermit kept in play,
Because he pleasure took with her to stay.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>His heart with love of that rare beauty glowed,
And to his frozen marrow pierced the heat;
Who, after, when he saw that she bestowed
Small care on him, and thought but of retreat,
His sluggish courser stung with many a goad;
But with no better speed he plied his feet.
Ill was his walk, and worse his trot; nor spur
Could that dull beast to quicker motion stir:</code></pre><blockquote>

And he would soon have ceased to track her steed,

And conjured up of fiends a grisly breed:
One he selected out of many more,
And first informed the demon of his need;
Then in the palfrey bade him play his part,
Who with the lady bore away his heart:</code></pre><blockquote>

Before, accustomed fox and hare to chase,

Already tearing what he crossed to face;
So her the hermit by a different road
Will meet, wherever she her palfrey goad.</code></pre><blockquote>

As fire sometimes will hide its smothered rage:
Then blazes with devouring flame and heat,
Unquenchable, and scarce allows retreat.</code></pre><blockquote>

Departs Bireno, to repeat his vows.</code></pre><blockquote>

Now, little for himself or uncle, driven
By a vain love, he cares, and less for heaven.</code></pre><blockquote>

Deserted cares; and comes where on the plain
Are camped the hosts of Afric and of Spain;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>III</p>

<pre><code>Rather uncamped: for, in less troops or more,
Rains under shed and tree had driven the band.

Each sleeps, oppressed with toil and wearied sore;
This stretched on earth, that propped upon his hand:

Yet never bared his puissant Durindane.</code></pre><blockquote>

And in the African so well was read,
He seemed in Tripoly one born and bred:</code></pre><blockquote>

Revisits, to its farthest little town.
Roves from Provence to Brittany&#39;s domain,
And from the Picards to the bounds of Spain.</code></pre><blockquote>

Then thundered, white with foam and flashing-spray:
And with impetuous stream had overtopt
Its brim, and burst the bridge, and passage stopt.</code></pre><blockquote>

She steered, as if she would approach the strand;
But would not let her shallop make the land.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>X</p>

<pre><code>Steered not to land; as haply with suspicion
To take a lading, in her own despite.

He shall his faith and promise duly plight,
That he will do a battle, at my prayer,
Upon the justest quarrel and most fair.</code></pre><blockquote>

To a voracious animal supplies;

Since he so long the missing maid pursues,
Nor of the damsel yet can gather news.</code></pre><blockquote>

Shifts to north-west, and freshening, blows so sore,
The mariners are fain to strike all sail,
And wear and scud before the boisterous gale.</code></pre><blockquote>

A port, where Antwerp&#39;s river met the main.</code></pre><blockquote>

Turns to the county, after greetings due,
Reputing him the leader of that crew.</code></pre><blockquote>

Should to his bark resort, to seek him there,

Seated the paladin, and sadly said:</code></pre><blockquote>

I never met refusal from the peer.
I living glady in this happy sort,
A duke by chance was guested at our court;</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>&quot;The Duke of Zealand, meaning for Biscay;
With purpose there to war upon the Moor;
His youth and beauty, then in manhood&#39;s May,

Persuaded by his outward cheer yet more,
I thought, and think, and still shall think, the peer
Loved me, and loves me yet with heart sincere.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIV</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Those days, whenas the wind was contrary,

On his return, in wedlock&#39;s holy band.</code></pre><blockquote>

Arbantes hight (the monarch had no more),
To Holland sent the worthiest of his land,

My very life-blood, than in Friesland wed.</code></pre><blockquote>

Conceived, and entertained such high disdain,
He entered Holland, and the war began,
In which my kin were slaughtered to a man.</code></pre><blockquote>

Are such, as in our age are matched of few,

Save him, of the ancient nations or the new:
A hollow iron, two yards long, whose small
Channel he loads with powder and a ball</code></pre><blockquote>

That bolt and lightening from the hollow cane
Appear to dart, and like the passing thunder,
Burn what they smite, beat-down or rend asunder.</code></pre><blockquote>

Bireno, who knew nought of this, had weighed,
And with his barks put forth to bring us aid.</code></pre><blockquote>

Of speech and life it reft him; I, who note
The deed, leap lightly up and cut his throat.</code></pre><blockquote>

In wedlock wished to join me with his son,
Haply to slay me when his end was won.</code></pre><blockquote>

Such cunning art Cymosco would assay:
But Roland would not be so lightly bought;
Like them by the first toil that springs betrayed;
And quickly forced the circle which was made.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVIII</p>

<pre><code>Where he perceives the assailants thickest stand,
He rests his lance, and sticks in his career
First one and afterwards another, and
Another, and another, who appear
Of paste; till six he of the circling band
Of foes impales upon a single spear;
A seventh left out, who by the push is slain,
Since the clogged weapon can no more contain.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>No otherwise, upon the further shore
Of fosse or of canal, the frogs we spy,
By cautious archer, practised in his lore,
Smote and transfixed the one the other nigh;
Upon the shaft, until it hold no more,
From barb to feathers full, allowed to lie.
The heavy lance Orlando from him flung,
And to close combat with his faulchion sprung.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXX</p>

<pre><code>The lance now broke, his sword the warrior drew,
That sword which never yet was drawn in vain,
And still with cut or thrust some soldier slew;
Now horse, now footman of the tyrant&#39;s train.
And, ever where he dealt a stroke, changed blue,
Yellow, green, white and black, to crimson stain.
Cymosco grieves, when most his need require,
Not to have now his hollow cane and fire;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXI</p>

<pre><code>And with loud voice and menacing command
Bids these be brought, but ill his followers hear;
For those who have found safety of his band,
To issue from the city are in fear.
He, when he sees them fly on either hand,
Would fly as well from that dread cavalier;
Makes for the gate, and would the drawbridge lift,
But the pursuing county is too swift.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The monarch turns his back, and leaves the knight
Lord of the drawbridge and of either gate.
Thanks to his swifter steed, the rest in flight
He passes: good Orlando will not wait
(Intent the felon, not his band, to smite)
Upon the vulgar herd to wreck his hate.
But his slow horse seems restive; while the king&#39;s,
More nimble, flies as if equipt with wings.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>From street to street, before the count he made;
And vanished clean; but after little stay,
Came with new arms, with tube and fire purveyed;
Which, at his hest, this while his men convey.
And posted at a corner, he waylaid:
His foe, as hunter watches for his prey,
In forest, with armed dogs and spear, attending
The boar in fury from the hill descending,</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Who rends the branch and overthrows the stone;
And wheresoe&#39;er he turns his haughty front,
Appears (so loud the deafening crash and groan)
As if he were uprending wood and mount,
Intent to make him his bold deed atone,
Cymosco at the pass expects the count;
As soon as he appears, with ready light
Touches the hole, and fires upon the knight.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Behind, the weapon flames in lightning&#39;s guise,
And vents the thunder from before; the ground
Shakes under foot and city wall; the skies
The fearful echo all about rebound.
The burning bolt with sudden fury flies,
Not sparing aught which in its course is found.
Hissing and whizzing through the skies it went;
But smote not, to the assassin&#39;s foul intent.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Whether it was his great desire to kill
That baron, or his hurry made him fail,
Or trembling heart, like leaf which flutters still,
Made hand and arm together flinch and quail;
Or that it was not the Creator&#39;s will
The church so soon her champion should bewail;
The glancing stroke his courser&#39;s belly tore,
Outstretched on earth, from thence to rise no more.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To earth fall horse and rider: this the knight
Scarce touched; the other thundering pressed the plain:
For the first rose so ready and so light,
He from the fall seemed breath and force to gain.
As African Anteus, in the fight,
Rose from the sand with prouder might and main;
So when Orlando touched the ground, to view
He rose with doubled force and vigour new.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVIII</p>

<pre><code>He who has seen the thunder, from on high,
Discharged by Jove with such a horrid sound,
Descend where nitre, coal, and sulphur lie,
Stored up for use in magazine profound,
Which scarce has reached — but touched it, ere the sky
Is in a flame, as well as burning ground,
Firm walls are split, and solid marbles riven,
And flying stones cast up as high as heaven;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIX</p>

<pre><code>Let him imagine, when from earth he sprung,
Such was the semblance of the cavalier;
Who moved in mode to frighten Mars among
The Gods, so fierce and horrid was his cheer.
At this dismay&#39;d, the King of Friesland stung
His horse, and turned his rein, to fly the peer:
But fierce Orlando was upon his foe
Faster than arrow flies from bended bow:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXX</p>

<pre><code>And, what before he could not, when possest
Of his good courser, now afoot will do.
His speed outgoes all thought in every breast,
Exceeds all credence, save in those who view.
The tyrant shortly joined, he on the crest
Smote at his head so well, he cleft it through;
And to the neck divided by the blow,
Sent it, to shake its last on earth below.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Lo!  in the frighted city other sound
Was heard to rise, and other crash of brands,
From troop, who, thither in his guidance bound,
Followed Bireno&#39;s cousin from his lands:
Who, since the unguarded gates he open found,
Into the city&#39;s heart had poured his bands;
Where the bold paladin had struck such fear,
He without let might scour it far and near.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXII</p>

<pre><code>In rout the people fly, who cannot guess
Who these may be, or what the foes demand:
But, when this man and that by speech and dress

Carte blanche they proffer, and the chief address,
Bidding him range them under his command;
Against the Frieslanders to lend him aid,
Who have their duke in loathsome prison stayed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To Friesland&#39;s king that people hatred bore
With all his following: who their ancient lord
Had put to death, and who by them yet more,
As evil and rapacious, was abhorred.
Orlando interposed with kindly lore,
As friend of both, the parties to accord:
By whom, so joined, no Frieslander was left
But was of life or liberty bereft.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXIV</p>

<pre><code>They would not wait to seek the dungeon-key,
But breaking-down the gate, their entrance made;
Bireno to the count with courtesy
And grateful thanks the service done repaid.
Thence they, together with large company,
Went where Olympia in her vessel stayed:
For so was the expecting lady hight,
To whom that island&#39;s crown belonged of right.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXV</p>

<pre><code>She who had thither good Orlando brought,
Not hoping that he would have thriven so well;

Her, full of love and loyal homage, sought
The people one and all:  Twere long to tell
How she caressed Bireno, he the maid, —
What thanks both lovers to the county paid.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The people, throned in her paternal reign,
Replace the injured dame, and fealty swear:
She on the duke, to whom in solid chain
Love with eternal knot had linked the fair,
The empire of herself and her domain
Conferred: He, called away by other care,
Left in the cousin&#39;s guardian care this while
His fortresses, and all the subject isle.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Since he to visit Zealand&#39;s duchy planned,
His faithful consort in his company;
And thence, upon the king of Friesland&#39;s land,
Would try his fortune (as he said), for he
A pledge, he rated highly, had in hand,
Which seemed of fair success the warranty,
The daughter of the king: who here forsaken,
With many others had been prisoner taken.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To a younger brother, her, the duke pretends,
To be conjoined in wedlock, he conveyed.
The Roman senator thence parting wends
Upon the very day Bireno weighed;
But he to nothing else his hand extends
Of all the many, many prized made,
Save to that engine, found amid the plunder,
Which in all points I said resembled thunder.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXIX</p>

<pre><code>Not with intent, in his defence to bear
What he had taken, of the prize possest;
For he still held it an ungenerous care
To go with vantage on whatever quest:
But with design to cast the weapon where
It never more should living wight molest;
And, what was appertaining to it, all
Bore off as well, the powder and the ball.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XC</p>

<pre><code>And thus, when of the tidesway he was clear,
And in the deepest sea his bark descried,
So that no longer distant signs appear

Down with thee to the darkest deep below!</code></pre><blockquote>

Meanwhile, with flowing sheet, his frigate goes,
By wind, which for the cruel island blows.</code></pre><blockquote>

Nor can an hour of life without her bear.
He fears, if he set foot on Ireland&#39;s shore,
Some other chance may interrupt him there:

In other strain, the tidings to report;
If you to hear that other strain resort.</code></pre><hr>

<p>ARGUMENT</p>

<pre><code>Another love assails Bireno&#39;s breast,
Who leaves one night Olympia on the shore.
To Logistilla&#39;s holy realm addressed,
Rogero goes, nor heeds Alcina more:
Him, of that flying courser repossest,
The hippogryph on airy voyage bore:
Whence he the good Rinaldo&#39;s levy sees,
And next Angelica beholds and frees.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>I</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Of all the loves, of all fidelity
Yet proved, of all the constant hearts and true,
Of all the lovers, in felicity
Or sorrow faithful found, a famous crew,
To Olympia I would give the first degree
Rather than second: if this be not due,
I well may say that hers no tale is told
Of truer love, in present times or old.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>II</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And this she by so many proofs and clear,
Had made apparent to the Zealand lord,
No woman&#39;s faith more certain could appear
To man, though he her open heart explored:
And if fair truth such spirits should endear,
And they in mutual love deserve reward,
Bireno as himself, nay, he above
Himself, I say, should kind Olympia love.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>III</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Not only should he nevermore deceive
Her for another, were that woman she
Who so made Europe and wide Asia grieve,
Or fairer yet, if one more fair there be;
But rather that quit her the light should leave,
And what is sweet to taste, touch, hear, and see,
And life and fame, and all beside; if aught
More precious can in truth be styled, or thought.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>If her Bireno loved, as she had loved
Bireno, if her love he did repay
With faith like hers, and still with truth unmoved,
Veered not his shifting sail another way;
Or ingrate for such service — cruel proved
For such fair love and faith, I now will say;
And you with lips comprest and eye-brows bent,
Shall listen to the tale for wonderment;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>V</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And when you shall have heard the impiety,
Which of such passing goodness was the meed,
Woman take warning from this perfidy,
And let none make a lover&#39;s word her creed.
Mindless that God does all things hear and see,
The lover, eager his desires to speed,
Heaps promises and vows, aye prompt to swear,
Which afterwards all winds disperse in air.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The promises and empty vows dispersed
In air, by winds all dissipated go,
After these lovers have the greedy thirst
Appeased, with which their fevered palates glow.
In this example which I offer, versed,
Their prayers and tears to credit be more slow.
Cheaply, dear ladies mine, is wisdom bought
By those who wit at other&#39;s cost are taught.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VII</p>

<pre><code>Of those in the first flower of youth beware,
Whose visage is so soft and smooth to sight:
For past, as soon as bred, their fancies are;
Like a straw fire their every appetite.
So the keen hunter follows up the hare
In heat and cold, on shore, or mountain-height;
Nor, when &#39;tis taken, more esteems the prize;
And only hurries after that which flies.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VIII</p>

<pre><code>Such is the practise of these striplings who,
What time you treat them with austerity,
Love and revere you, and such homage do,

From mistresses shall servants grieve to be;
And mourn to see the fickle love they owed,
From you diverted, and elsewhere bestowed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>I not for this (for that were wrong opine ) 

That you should cease to love; for you, without
A lover, like uncultivated vine,
Would be, that has no prop to wind about.
But the first down I pray you to decline,
To fly the volatile, inconstant rout;
To make your choice the riper fruits among,
Nor yet to gather what too long has hung.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>X</p>

<pre><code>A daughter they have found (above was said)
Of the proud king who ruled the Friesland state;
That with Bireno&#39;s brother was to wed,
As far as rumour tells; but to relate
The truth, a longing in Bireno bred
The sight of food so passing delicate;
And he to talk his palate deemed would be,
For other&#39;s sake, a foolish courtesy.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XI</p>

<pre><code>The gentle damsel had not past fourteen,
Was beautiful and fresh, and like a rose,
When this first opening from its bud is seen,
And with the vernal sun expands and grows.

Were little; with less blaze lit tinder glows,
Or ripened corn, wherever envious hand
Of foe amid the grain has cast a brand,</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Than that which on Bireno&#39;s bosom fed,
And to his marrow burned; when, weeping sore
The fate of her unhappy father dead,
He saw her bathed in ceaseless tears deplore:
And, as cold water, on the cauldron shed,
Shops short the bubbling wave, which boiled before;
So was the raging rife Olympia blew
Within his breast, extinguished by a new.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Nor feels Bireno mere satiety;
He loathes her so, he ill endures her sight;
And, if his hope he long deferred, will die:
For other such his fickle appetite!
Yet till the day prefixed to satisfy
His fond desire, so feigns the wary knight,
Olympia less to love than to adore
He seems, and but her pleasure to explore.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And if the other he too much caress,
Who cannot but caress her, there are none
See evil in the deed, but rather guess
It is in pity, is in goodness done:
Since to raise up and comfort in distress
Whom Fortune&#39;s wheel beats down in changeful run,
Was never blamed; with glory oftener paid;
— So much the more, a young — a harmless maid.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Almighty God!  how fallible and vain
Is human judgment, dimmed by clouds obscure!
Bireno&#39;s actions, impious and profane,
By others are reputed just and pure.
Already stooping to their oars, the train
Have loosed his vessel from the port secure,
And with the duke and his companions steer
For Zealand through the deep, with meery cheer.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Already Holland and its headlands all
Are left astern, and now descried no more;
Since to shun Friesland they to larboard hawl.
And keep their course more nigh the Scottish shore:
When they are overtaken by a squall,
And drive three days the open sea before:
Upon the third, when now, near eventide,
A barren and unpeopled isle is spied.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>As soon as they were harboured in a hight,
Olympia landed and the board was spread;
She there contented, with the faithless knight,
Supt, unsuspecting any cause for dread.
Thence, with Bireno, where a tent was pight
In pleasant place, repaired, and went to bed.
The others of their train returned abroad,
And rested in their ship, in haven moored.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The fear and late sea sorrow, which had weighed
So long upon the dame and broke her rest,
The finding herself safe in greenwood shade
Removed from noise, and, for her tranquil breast

No further thoughts, no further cares molest,
Olympia lap in slumber so profound,
No sheltered bear or dormouse sleeps more sound.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The lover false, who, hatching treason lies,
Stole from his bed in silence, when he knew
She slept: his clothes he in a bundle ties,
Nor other raiment on his body threw.
Then issuing forth from the pavilion hies,
As if on new-born wings, towards his crew;
Who, roused, unmoor without a cry, as he
Commands, and loosen thence and put to sea.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Behind the land was left; and there to pine
Olympia, who yet slept the woods among;
Till from her gilded wheels the frosty rhine
Aurora upon earth beneath had flung;
And the old woe, beside the tumbling brine,
Lamenting, halcyons mournful descant sung;
When she, &#39;twixt sleep and waking, made a strain
To reach her loved Bireno, but in vain.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>She no one found: the dame her arm withdrew;
She tried again, yet no one found; she spread
Both arms, now here, now there, and sought anew;
Now either leg; but yet no better sped.
Fear banished sleep; she oped her eyes: in view
Was nothing: she no more her widowed bed
Would keep, but from the couch in fury sprung,
And headlong forth from the pavilion flung.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And seaward ran, her visage tearing sore,
Presaging, and now certain of her plight:
She beat her bosom, and her tresses tore,
And looked (the moon was shining if she might ) 

Discover any thing beside the shore;
Nor, save the shore, was any thing in sight.
She calls Bireno, and the caverns round,
Pitying her grief, Bireno&#39;s name rebound.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>On the far shore there rose a rock; below
Scooped by the breaker&#39;s beating frequently:
The cliff was hollowed underneath, in show
Of arch, and overhung the foaming sea.
Olympia (MIND such vigour did bestow)
Sprang up the frowning crest impetuously,
And, at a distance, stretched by favouring gale,
Thence saw her cruel lord&#39;s departing sail.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Saw it, or seemed to see: for ill her eyes,
Things through the air, yet dim and hazy, view.
She falls, all-trembling, on the ground, and lies
With face than snow more cold and white in hue:
But when she has again found strength to rise,
Guiding her voice towards the bark which flew,
Calling with all her might, the unhappy dame
Calls often on her cruel consort&#39;s name.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Where unavailing was the feeble note,
She wept and clapt her hands in agony.
&quot;Without its freight,&quot; she cried, &quot;thy ship does float.
— Where, cruel, dost thou fly so swiftly? — Me
Receive as well: — small hinderance to thy boat,
Which bears my spirit, would my body be.&quot;
And she her raiment waving in her hand,
Signed to the frigate to return to land.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But the loud wind which, sweeping ocean, bears
The faithless stripling&#39;s sail across the deep,
Bears off as well the shriek, and moan, and prayers
Of sad Olympia, sorrowing on the steep.
Thrice, cruel to herself, the dame prepares
From the high rock amid the waves to leap.
But from the water lifts at length her sight,
And there returns where she had passed the night.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVII</p>

<pre><code>Stretched on the bed, upon her face she lay,
Bathing it with her tears.  &quot;Last night in thee
Together two found shelter,&quot; did she say;

That I was born!  What here remains to me
To do?  What can be done? — Alone, betrayed —
Who will console me, who afford me aid?</code></pre><blockquote>

My eyes, or give me sepulture, be by,
Save wolf perchance, who roves this wood, a tomb
Give me, alas!  in his voracious womb.</code></pre><blockquote>

Enough for them to slay me once!  while I
Am made by thee a thousand deaths to die.</code></pre><blockquote>

Would rest his weary limbs, beside them laid.&#39;</code></pre><blockquote>

To Alcina to arrive, who now was nigh.</code></pre><blockquote>

Scorns them, who yet believe they beauteous are,
Kindled the third of those three damsels fair.</code></pre><blockquote>

Burned, gibbeted, or cut in quarters see!&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>

And plying fast her oars, pursues the knight
Along the sandy beach, still kept in sight.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>On him with threat and curse she ever cried;
Whose tongue collected still fresh cause for blame.
Meanwhile, where to the lovelier fairy&#39;s side

Put from the other shore with punctual aim,
As if forewarned and well prepared, the seer
Waited the coming of the cavalier.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIV</p>

<pre><code>The ferryman put forth the Child to meet,
To bear him to a better shore rejoicing: he
Appeared as all benign and all discreet,
If of the heart the face is warranty.
Giving God thanks, Rogero took his seat
Aboard the bark, and passed the quiet sea,
Discoursing with that ancient pilot, fraught
With wisdom, and by long experience taught.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLV</p>

<pre><code>He praised Rogero much, that he had fled
In time from false Alcina, and before
To him the dame had given the chalice dread,
Her lover&#39;s final guerdon evermore.

Where he should duly witness holy lore,
And beauty infinite and grace enjoy,
Which feed and nourish hearts they never cloy.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>&quot;Her shall you, struck with wonderment, revere,&quot;
(He said), &quot;when first you shall behold the fay;
But better contemplate her lofty cheer,
And you no other treasure shall appay.
In this her love from other differs; fear
And hope in other on the bosom prey:
In hers Desire demands not aught beside,
And with the blessing seen is satisfied.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVII</p>

<pre><code>&quot;You shall in nobler studies be professed,
Tutored by her, than bath and costly fare,
Song, dance, and perfumes; as how fashioned best,
Your thoughts may tower more high than hawks in air;
And how some of the glory of the blest
You here may in the mortal body share.&quot;
So speaking, and yet distant from the shore,
To the safe bank approached the pilot hoar.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVIII</p>

<pre><code>When he beholds forth-issuing from the strand,
A fleet of ships, which all towards him steer.
With these came wronged Alcina, with a band
Of many vassals, gathered far and near;
To risk the ruin of herself and land,

Love, no light cause, incites the dame aggrieved,
Nor less the bitter injury received.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIX</p>

<pre><code>Such choler she had never felt before
As that which now upon her bosom fed:
And hence she made her followers ply the oar
Till the white foam on either bank was shed
The deafening noise and din o&#39;er sea and shore,
By echo every where repeated, spread,
&quot;Now — now, Rogero, bare the magic shield,
Or in the strife be slain, or basely yield&quot;:</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Thus Logistilla&#39;s pilot; and beside,
So saying, seized the pouch, wherein was dight
The buckler, and the covering torn aside,
Exposed to open view the shining light.
The enchanted splendor, flashing far and wide,
So sore offends the adversaries&#39; sight,
They from their vessels drop amazed and blind,
Tumbling from prow before, and poop behind.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>One who stood sentry on the citadel
Descried the navy of the invading dame,
And backwards rang the castle larum-bell,

So that such aid was brought him in the strife,
As saved the warrior&#39;s liberty and life.</code></pre><blockquote>

Conspicuous flames.  Forth issues from the fort
A matchless host, and files towards the port.</code></pre><blockquote>

And furious, waged on part of either fay:
Whence was Alcina&#39;s realm turned upside down,
Of which she had usurped her sister&#39;s crown.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Oh!  of how many battles the success
Is different from what was hoped before!
Not only failed the dame to repossess,

From all her vessels, to the flames a prey,
But with one bark escaped the wretched fay.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LV</p>

<pre><code>Alcina flies; and her sad troop around
Routed and taken, burnt or sunk, remains
To have lost Rogero, sorrow more profound
Wakes in her breast than all her other pains;
And she in bitter tears for ever drowned,
Of the Child&#39;s loss by night and day complains;
And bent to end her woes, with many a sigh,
Often laments her that she cannot die.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>No fairy dies, or can, while overhead
The sun shall burn, or heaven preserve their stile,
Or Clotho had been moved to cut her thread,
Touched by such grief; or, as on funeral pile
Fair Dido, she beneath the steel had bled;
Or, haply, like the gorgeous Queen of Nile,
In mortal slumber would have closed her eye:
But fairies cannot at their pleasure die.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVII</p>

<pre><code>Return we, where eternal fame is due,
Leaving Alcina in her trouble sore:
I speak of valorous Rogero, who
Had disembarked upon the safer shore.
He turned his back upon the waters blue,
Giving God thanks for all with pious lore;
And on dry ground now landed, made repair
Towards the lofty castle planted there.</code></pre><blockquote>

Must thither speed: none such elsewhere, I ween,
Except perhaps in heaven above, are seen.</code></pre><blockquote>

His form he in the lucid mirror eyes,
And by the knowledge of himself grows wise.</code></pre><blockquote>

Upon its widowed stalk the blossom dies,
Subject to all the changes of the skies.</code></pre><blockquote>

There in few days resorted all the crew,
Changed by Melissa to their shapes anew.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>When they a day or more their weariness
Had eased, Rogero sought the prudent fay;
With him the duke Astolpho, who no less

To favour, warn and help them, prayed the dame;
So that they might return from whence they came.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVI</p>

<pre><code>&quot;I&quot; (said the fay &quot;will think upon this need, ) 

And in two days the pair will expedite.&quot;
Then thought how good Rogero she should speed.
And afterwards how aid the English knight.
She wills the first shall, on the griffin steed,
To the Aquitanian shores direct his flight;
But first will fashion for the flying-horse
A bit, to guide him and restrain his course.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVII</p>

<pre><code>She shows him what to do, if he on high
Would make him soar, or down to earth would bring,
And what, would he in circles make him fly,
Or swiftly speed, or pause upon the wing.
And all that skilful horsemen use to try
Upon plain ground, beneath her tutoring,
Rogero learned in air, and gained dominion
Over the griffin-steed of soaring pinion.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>When at all points Rogero was prepared,
He bade farewell to the protecting fay,
For ever to the loving knight endeared,
And issued from her realm upon his way.
I first of him, who on his journey fared
In happy hour, and afterwards shall say
Of the English knight, who spent more time and pain
Seeking the friendly court of Charlemagne.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Rogero thence departs; but as before
Takes not the way he took in his despite,
When him above the sea the courser bore,
And seldom was the land beneath in sight.
But taught to make him beat his wings and soar,
Here, there, as liked him best, with docile flight,
Returning, he another path pursued;
As Magi erst, who Herod&#39;s snare eschewed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXX</p>

<pre><code>Borne hither, good Rogero, leaving Spain,
Had sought, in level line, the Indian lands,
Where they are watered by the Eastern main;
Where the two fairies strove with hostile bands.
He now resolved to visit other reign
Than that where Aeolus his train commands;
And finish so the round he had begun,
Circling the world beneath him like the sun.</code></pre><blockquote>

Passing the great Quinsay beheld; in air
Above Imavus turned, and Sericane
Left on the right; and thence did ever bear
From the north Scythians to the Hyrcanian main:
So reached Sarmatia&#39;s distant land; and, where
Europe and Asia&#39;s parted climes divide,
Russ, Prussian, he and Pomeranian spied.</code></pre><blockquote>

Quickly to seek his Bradamant, yet he

Inhabiting that horrid, northern land;
And came at last to England&#39;s farthest strand.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Yet think not, sir, that in so long a flight,
The warrior is for ever on the wing.
Who lodges, housed in tavern every night,
As best as can, through his capacious ring.
So nights and days he passes: such delight
Prospects to him of land and ocean bring.
Arrived one morn nigh London-town, he stopt;
And over Thames the flying courser dropt.</code></pre><blockquote>

To have been sent by Charlemagne, and made
His envoy to these parts in search of aid.</code></pre><blockquote>

English, Scotch, Irish, and the Islands nigh,
Those many banners were, upreared on high:</code></pre><blockquote>

Destined to be a monster&#39;s evil prey:</code></pre><blockquote>

Where (to devour a living damsel sped)
The orc, that measureless sea-monster, hies,
Which on abominable food is fed.

Who found her sleeping near the enchanter hoar,
Who her had thither brought by magic lore.</code></pre><blockquote>

Which mingled in her lovely members meet,
Proof to December-snow and July-heat.</code></pre><blockquote>

Amid fresh-opening rose and lily fair,
Stand on her budding paps beneath in dew,
And that her golden hair dishevelled flew.</code></pre><blockquote>

&quot;O lady, worthy but that chain to wear,
With which Love&#39;s faithful servants fettered are,</code></pre><blockquote>

Of crimson spreading on an ivory ground;
Knowing those secret beauties are espied,
Which, howsoever lovely, shame would hide;</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>And gladly with her hands her face would hood,
Were they not fastened to the rugged stone:
But with her tears (for this at least she could)
Bedewed it, and essayed to hold it down.
Sobbing some while the lovely damsel stood;
Then loosed her tongue and spake in feeble tone;
But ended not; arrested in mid-word,
By a loud noise which in the sea was heard.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>C</p>

<pre><code>Lo!  and behold!  the unmeasured-beast appears,
Half surging and half hidden, in such sort
As sped by roaring wind long carack steers
From north or south, towards her destined port.

Half dead the lady is through fear endured,
Ill by that other&#39;s comfort reassured.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>Rogero overhand, not in the rest
Carries his lance, and beats, with downright blow,
The monstrous orc.  What this resembled best,
But a huge, writhing mass, I do not know;
Which wore no form of animal exprest,
Save in the head, with eyes and teeth of sow.
His forehead, &#39;twixt the eyes, Rogero smites,
But as on steel or rock the weapon lights.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>CII</p>

<pre><code>When he perceives the first of no avail,
The knight returns to deal a better blow;
The orc, who sees the shifting shadow sail
Of those huge pinions on the sea below,
In furious heat, deserts his sure regale
On shore, to follow that deceitful show:
And rolls and reels behind it, as it fleets.
Rogero drops, and oft the stroke repeats.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>CIII</p>

<pre><code>As eagle, that amid her downward flight,
Surveys amid the grass a snake unrolled,
Or where she smoothes upon a sunny height,
Her ruffled plumage, and her scales of gold,

To hiss and creep; but with securer hold
Gripes it behind, and either pinion clangs,
Lest it should turn and wound her with its fangs;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>CIV</p>

<pre><code>So the fell orc Rogero does not smite
With lance or faulchion where the tushes grow,
But aims that &#39;twixt the ears his blow may light;
Now on the spine, or now on tail below.
And still in time descends or soars upright,
And shifts his course, to cheat the veering foe:
But as if beating on a jasper block,
Can never cleave the hard and rugged rock.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>With suchlike warfare is the mastiff vext
By the bold fly in August&#39;s time of dust,

Whose sting into his eyes or snout is thrust:
And oft the dog&#39;s dry teeth are heard to fall;
But reaching once the foe, he pays for all.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>With his huge tail the troubled waves so sore
The monster beats, that they ascend heaven-high;

He fears it so will bathe his hippogryph,
That he shall vainly covet gourd or skiff.</code></pre><blockquote>

With other arms the monster to pursue;
And lifting from his shield the covering vest,
To dazzle with the light his blasted view.
Landward towards the rock-chained maid he pressed,
And on her little finger, lest a new
Mischance should follow, slipt the ring, which brought
The enchantment of the magic shield to nought.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>CVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>I say the ring, which Bradamant, to free
Rogero, from Brunello&#39;s hand had rent,
And which, to snatch him from Alcina, she
Had next to India by Melissa sent.
Melissa (as before was said by me),
In aid of many used the instrument;
And to Rogero this again had born;
By whom &#39;twas ever on his finger worn.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>CIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He gave it now Angelica; for he
Feared lest the buckler&#39;s light should be impaired,
And willed as well those beauteous eyes should be
Defended, which had him already snared.
Pressing beneath his paunch full half the sea,
Now to the shore the monstrous whale repaired:
Firm stood Rogero, and the veil undone,
Appeared to give the sky another sun.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>CX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He in the monster&#39;s eyes the radiance throws,
Which works as it was wont in other time.
As trout or grayling to the bottom goes
In stream, which mountaineer disturbs with lime;
So the enchanted buckler overthrows
The orc, reversed among the foam and slime.
Rogero here and there the beast astound
Still beats, but cannot find the way to wound.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>CXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>This while the lady begs him not to bray
Longer the monster&#39;s rugged scale in vain.
&quot;For heaven&#39;s sake turn and loose me&quot; (did she say,
Still weeping &quot;ere the orc awake again. ) 

Bear me with thee, and drown me in mid-way.
Let me not this foul monster&#39;s food remain.&quot;
By her just plaint Rogero moved, forebore,
Untied the maid, and raised her from the shore.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>CXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Upon the beach the courser plants his feet,
And goaded by the rowel, towers in air,
And gallops with Rogero in mid seat,
While on the croup behind him sate the fair;
Who of his banquet so the monster cheat;
For him too delicate and dainty fare.
Rogero turns and with thick kisses plies
The lady&#39;s snowy breast and sparkling eyes.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>CXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He kept no more the way, as he before
Proposed, for compassing the whole of Spain:
But stopt his courser on the neighbouring shore
Where lesser Britain runs into the main.
Upon the bank there rose an oakwood hoar,
Where Philomel for ever seemed to plain;
I&#39; the middle was a meadow with a fountain,
And, at each end, a solitary mountain.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>CXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&#39;Twas here the wishful knight first checked the rein,
And dropping in the meadow, made his steed
Furl, yet not shut so close, his wings again,
As he had spread them wide for better speed.
Down lights Rogero, and forbears with pain
From other leap; but this his arms impede:
His arms impede; a bar to his desire,
And he must doff them would he slake the fire.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>CXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Now here, now there, confused by different throng,
Rogero did his shining arms undo:
Never the task appeared to him so long;
For where he loosed one knot, he fastened two.
But, sir, too long continued is this song,
And haply may as well have wearied you;
So that I shall delay to other time,
When it may better please, my tedious rhyme.</code></pre><hr>
<h4>Canto 11</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>ARGUMENT</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Assisted by the magic ring she wears,
Angelica evanishes from view.
Next in a damsel, whom a giant bears
Beneath his arm, his bride Rogero true
Beholds.  Orlando to the shore repairs,
Where the fell orc so many damsels slew;
Olympia frees, and spoils the beast of life:
Her afterwards Oberto takes to wife.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>I</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Although a feeble rein, in mid career,
Will oft suffice to stop courageous horse;
&#39;Tis seldom Reason&#39;s bit will serve to steer
Desire, or turn him from his furious course,
When pleasure is in reach: like headstrong bear,
Whom from the honeyed meal &#39;tis ill to force,
If once he scent the tempting mess, or sup
A drop, which hangs upon the luscious cup.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>II</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>What reason then Rogero shall withhold
From taking with Angelica delight, —
That gentle maid, there naked in his hold,
In the lone forest, and secure from sight?
Of Bradamant he thinks not, who controlled
His bosom erst: and foolish were the knight,
If thinking of that damsel as before,
By this he had not set an equal store;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>III</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Warmed by whose youthful beauties, the severe
Xenocrates would not have been more chaste.
The impatient Child had dropt both shield and spear,
And hurrying now his other arms uncased;
When, casting down her eyes in shame and fear,
The virtuous ring upon her finger placed,
Angelica descried, and which of yore
From her Brunello in Albracca bore.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>This is the ring she carried into France,
When thither first the damsel took her way;
With her the brother, bearer of the lance,
After, the paladin, Astolpho&#39;s prey.
With this she Malagigi&#39;s spells and trance
Made vain by Merlin&#39;s stair; and on a day
Orlando freed, with many knights and good,
From Dragontina&#39;s cruel servitude:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>V</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>With this passed viewless from the turret-cell,
Where her that bad old man had mewed; but why
Recount its different wonders, if as well
You know the virtues of the ring as I?
From her this even in her citadel,
His monarch Agramant to satisfy,
Brunello took: since where she had been crost
By Fortune, till her native realm was lost.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Now that she this upon her hand surveys,
She is so full of pleasure and surprise,
She doubts it is a dream, and, in amaze,
Hardly believes her very hand and eyes.
Then softly to her mouth the hoop conveys,
And, quicker than the flash which cleaves the skies,
From bold Rogero&#39;s sight her beauty shrowds,
As disappears the sun, concealed in clouds.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Yet still Rogero gazed like wight distraught,
And hurried here and there with fruitless speed:
But when he had recalled the ring to thought,
Foiled and astounded, cursed his little heed.
And now the vanished lady, whom he sought,
Of that ungrateful and discourteous deed
Accusing stood, wherewith she had repaid,
(Unfitting recompense his generous aid. ) 
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Ungrateful damsel!  and is this the pay
You render for the service done?&quot; (said he)
&quot;Why rather would you steal my ring away
Than have it as a welcome gift from me?
Not only this, (but use me as you may)
I, and my shield and courser, yours shall be;
So you no more conceal your beauteous cheer.
Cruel, though answering not, I know you hear.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>So saying, like one blind, with bootless care,
Feeling his way about the fount he strayed.
How often he embraced the empty air,
Hoping in this to have embraced the maid!
Meanwhile, now far removed, the flying fair
Had halted not, till to a cave conveyed.
Formed in a mountain was that harbour rude;
Spacious, and for her need supplied with food.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>X</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&#39;Twas here an aged herdsman, one who tended
A numerous troop of mares, had made his won:
These, seeking pasture, through the valley wended,
Where the green grass was fed by freshening run:
While stalls on either side the cave, defended
His charge from the oppressive noon-tide sun;
Angelica, within, that livelong day,
Unseen of prying eyes, prolonged her stay;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And about evening, when refreshed with rest
And food, she deemed her course she might renew;
In certain rustic weeds her body dressed:
How different from those robes of red, or blue,
Green, yellow, purple, her accustomed vest,
So various in its fashion, shape, and hue!
Yet her not so that habit misbecame,
But that she looked the fair and noble dame.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Then Phillis&#39; and Neaera&#39;s praise forbear,
And ye who sing of Amaryllis cease,
Or flying Galataea, not so fair,
Tityrus and Melibaeus, with your peace!
&#39;Twas here the beauteous lady took a mare,
Which liked her best, of all that herd&#39;s increase.
Then, and then first conceived the thought, again
To seek in the Levant her antient reign.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>This while Rogero, after he had passed
Long space in hope the maid might re-appear,
Awakened from his foolish dream at last,
And found she was not nigh, and did not hear.
Then to remount his griffin-courser cast,
In earth and air accustomed to career.
But, having slipt his bit, the winged horse
Had towered and soared in air a freer course.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To his first ill addition grave and sore
Was to have lost the bird of rapid wing,
Which he no better than the mockery bore
Put on him by the maid; but deeper sting
Than this or that, implants, and pains him more,
The thought of having lost the precious ring;
Not for its power so much, esteemed above
Its worth, as given him by his lady love.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Afflicted beyond measure, he, with shield
Cast on his shoulder, and new-cased in mail,
Left the sea-side, and through a grassy field
Pursued his way, towards a spacious vale:
Where he beheld a path, by wood concealed,
The widest and most beaten in the dale.
Nor far had wound the closest shades within,
Ere on his right he heard a mighty din.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He heard a din, and fearful clashing sound
Of arms, and hurrying on with eager pace
&#39;Twixt tree and tree, two furious champions found,
Waging fierce fight in close and straightened place:
Who to each other (warring on what ground
I know not neither showed regard nor grace. ) 

The one a giant was of haughty cheer,
And one a bold and gallant cavalier.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Covered with shield and sword, one, leaping, sped
Now here now there, and thus himself defended,
Lest a two-handed mace upon his head
Should fall, with which the giant still offended: —
On the field lay his horse, already dead.
Rogero paused, and to the strife attended:
And straight his wishes leant towards the knight,
Whom he would fain see conqueror in the fight:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Yet not for this would lend the champion aid,
But to behold the cruel strife stood nigh.
Lo!  a two-handed stroke the giant made
Upon the lesser warrior&#39;s casque, and by
The mighty blow the knight was overlaid:
The other, when astound he saw him lie,
To deal the foe his death, his helm untied,
So that the warrior&#39;s face Rogero spied.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Of his sweet lady, of his passing fair,
And dearest Bradamant Rogero spies
The lovely visage of its helmet bare;
Towards whom, to deal her death, the giant hies:
So that, advancing with his sword in air,
To sudden battle him the Child defies,
But he, who will not wait for new alarm,
Takes the half-lifeless lady in his arm,</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And on his shoulder flings and bears away;
As sometimes wolf a little lamb will bear,
Or eagle in her crooked claws convey
Pigeon, or such-like bird, through liquid air.
Rogero runs with all the speed he may,
Who sees how needed is his succour there.
But with such strides the giant scours the plain,
Him with his eyes the knight pursues with pain.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>This flying and that following, the two
Kept a close path which widened still, and they
Piercing that forest, issued forth to view
On a wide meadow, which without it lay.
— No more of this.  Orlando I pursue,
That bore Cymosco&#39;s thunder-bolt away;
And this had in the deepest bottom drowned,
That never more the mischief might be found.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXII</p>

<pre><code>But with small boot: for the impious enemy
Of human nature, taught the bolt to frame,

Pierces the cloud and comes to ground in flame,

With the apple, hardly wrought more scathe and shame,
Some deal before, or in our grandsires&#39; day,
Guided a necromancer where it lay.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIII</p>

<pre><code>More than a hundred fathom buried so,
Where hidden it had lain a mighty space,
The infernal tool by magic from below
Was fished and born amid the German race;

The demon, working on their weaker wit,
As last upon its fatal purpose hit.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>How, foul and pestilent discovery,

Whose foul inhabitants a monster sate
With flesh of women, fair and delicate.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>But no less slow than eager was the knight:
The winds appear, which still his course delay;
Who, whether blowing on the left or right,

Or blows so foul, that he is fain to steer
Another course, or to the leeward veer.</code></pre><blockquote>

Not without stirring jealous Tithon&#39;s spite.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIII</p>

Naked as born, bound to a stump, espied
A dame whose feet were wetted by the tide.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIV</p>

<pre><code>Because she distant is, and evermore
Holds down her face, he ill can her discern:
Both sculls he pulls amain, and nears the shore,

The billows swell, and, lo!  the beast!  who pressed,
And nigh concealed the sea beneath his breast.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXV</p>

<pre><code>As cloud from humid vale is seen to rise,
Pregnant with rain and storm, which seems withal

Leaving within the sheath his idle brand,
Anchor and cable next he takes in hold,
And waits the foe with constant heart and bold.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVII</p>

Plunged, and engulphed the parted teeth betwixt,
His anchor in the tongue and palate fixt;</code></pre><blockquote>

Or raise his horrid jaws, which this extends.

The assailants, can defend her from her foes,

Defends himself against the Paladin.</code></pre><blockquote>

He leaves the anchor fastened in his tongue,
And grasps the rope which from the anchor hung.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLI</p>

With this towards the rock Orlando speeds:
He hawls the anchor home (a footing gained),
Pricked by whose double fluke, the monster bleeds.

Dragged by that force which every force exceeds;
Which at a single sally more achieves
Than at ten turns the circling windlass heaves.</code></pre><blockquote>

Dragged by that arm and rope he cannot tear,
With thousands of strange wheels and thousand slides,
The monster follows where the cable guides.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIII</p>

<pre><code>This the red sea with reason would be hight
To-day, such streams of blood have changed its hue;

The noise re-echoing round, the distant shore
And wood and hill rebound the deafening roar.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIV</p>

Neptune bids yoke his dolphins, and that day
For distant Aethiopia posts away.</code></pre><blockquote>

Oberto comes; Oberto, he that reigns
O&#39;er Ireland&#39;s people, who had understood
How lifeless lay the monster of the flood;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And, swimming, how, amid the watery roar,
A knight a weighty anchor in his throat
Had fix&#39;d, and so had dragged him to the shore,
As men against the current track a boat.
This while Oberto comes; who, if his lore,
Who told the tale, were true, desires to note;
While his invading army, far and wide,
Ebuda burn and waste on every side.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Oberto, though the Paladin to sight
Was dripping, and with water foul and gore;
With gore, that from the orc, emerged to light,
Whom he had entered bodily, he bore,
He for the country knew the stranger knight
As he perused his face; so much the more,
That he had thought when told the tidings, none
Save Roland could such mighty fear have done;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Knew him, because a page of honour he
Had been in France, and for the crown, his right
Upon his father&#39;s death, had crossed the sea
The year before.  So often he the knight
Had seen, and had with him held colloquy,
Their times of meeting had been infinite.
He doffed his casque, with festive welcome pressed
Towards the count, and clasped him to the breast.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Orlando is no less rejoined to see
The king, than is the king that champion true.
After with friendly cheer and equal glee
Had once or twice embraced the noble two,
To Oberto Roland told the treachery
Which had been done the youthful dame, and who
Had done it, — false Bireno — that among
All men should least have sought to do her wrong.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To him he told the many proofs and clear
By which the dame&#39;s affection had been tried;
And how she for Bireno kin and geer
Had lost, and would in fine for him have died.
And how he this could warrant, and appear
To vouch for much, as witness on her side.
While thus to him her griefs Orlando showed,
The lady&#39;s shining eyes with tears o&#39;erflowed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Her face was such as sometimes in the spring
We see a doubtful sky, when on the plain
A shower descends, and the sun, opening
His cloudy veil, looks out amid the rain.
And as the nightingale then loves to sing
From branch of verdant stem her dulcet strain,
So in her beauteous tears his pinions bright
Love bathes, rejoicing in the chrystal light.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The stripling heats his golden arrow&#39;s head
At her bright eyes, then slacks the weapon&#39;s glow
In streams, which falls between white flowers and red;
And, the shaft tempered, strongly draws his bow,
And roves at him, o&#39;er whom no shield is spread,
Nor iron rind, nor double mail below;
Who, gazing on her tresses, eyes, and brow,
Feels that his heart is pierced, he knows not how.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Olympia&#39;s beauties are of those most rare,
Nor is the forehead&#39;s beauteous curve alone
Excellent, and her eyes and cheeks and hair,
Mouth, nose, and throat, and shoulders; but, so down
Descending from the lady&#39;s bosom fair,
Parts which are wont to be concealed by gown,
Are such, as haply should be placed before
Whate&#39;er this ample world contains in store.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>In whiteness they surpassed unsullied snow,
Smooth ivory to the touch: above were seen
Two rounding paps, like new-pressed milk in show,
Fresh-taken from its crate of rushes green;
The space betwixt was like the valley low,
Which oftentimes we see small hills between,
Sweet in its season, and now such as when
Winter with snows has newly filled the glen.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The swelling hips and haunches&#39; symmetry,
The waist more clear than mirror&#39;s polished grain,
And members seem of Phidias&#39; turnery,
Or work of better hand and nicer pain.
As well to you of other parts should I
Relate, which she to hide desired in vain.
To sum the beauteous whole, from head to feet,
In her all loveliness is found complete.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And had she in the Idaean glen unveiled
In ancient days before the Phrygian swain,
By how much heavenly Venus had prevailed
I know not, though her rivals strove in vain.
Nor haply had the youth for Sparta sailed,
To violate the hospitable reign;
But said:  &quot;With Menelaus let Helen rest!
No other prize I seek, of this possest&quot;;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Or in Crotona dwelt, where the divine
Zeuxis in days of old his work projected,
To be the ornament of Juno&#39;s shrine,
And hence so many naked dames collected;
And in one form perfection to combine,
Some separate charm from this or that selected,
He from no other model need have wrought.
Since joined in her were all the charms he sought.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>I do not think Bireno ever viewed
Naked that beauteous form; for sure it were
He never could have been so stern of mood,
As to have left her on that desert lair.
That Ireland&#39;s king was fired I well conclude,
Nor hid the flame that he within him bare.
He strives to comfort her, and hope instill,
That future good shall end her present ill.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And her to Holland promises to bear,
And vows till she is to her state restored,
And just and memorable vengeance there
Achieved upon her perjured, traitor lord,
He never will unceasing war forbear,
Waged with all means that Ireland can afford;
And this with all his speed.  He, up and down,
Meantime bids seek for female vest and gown.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Now will it need to send in search of vest
Beyond the savage island&#39;s narrow bound,
Since thither every day in such came dressed,
Some dame, to feed the beast, from countries round.
Nor long his followers there pursued the quest,
Ere many they of various fashions found.
So was Olympia clothed; while sad of mood
Was he, not so to clothe her as he wou&#39;d.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But never silk so choice or gold so fine
Did the industrious Florentine prepare,
Nor whosoever broiders gay design,
Though on his task be spent time, toil, and care,
Nor Lemnos&#39; god, nor Pallas&#39; art divine,
Form raiment worthy of those limbs so fair,
That King Oberto cannot choose but he
Recalls them at each turn to memory.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To see that love so kindled by the dame,
On many grounds Orlando was content;
Who not alone rejoiced that such a shame
Put upon her, Bireno should repent;
But, that in the design on which he came,
He should be freed from grave impediment.
Not for Olympia thither had he made,
But, were his lady there, to lend her aid.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To him, that there she was not, soon was clear,
But clear it was not if she had been there,
Or no; since of those islesmen, far and near,
One was not left the tidings to declare.
The following day they from the haven steer,
And all united in one squadron fare.
The Paladin with them to Ireland hies,
From whence to France the warrior&#39;s passage lies.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Scarcely a day in Ireland&#39;s realm he spends:
And for no prayers his purposed end forbore:
Love, that in quest of his liege-lady sends
The knight upon this track, permits no more.
Departing, he Olympia recommends
To the Irish monarch, who to serve her swore:
Although this needed not; since he was bent
More than behoved, her wishes to content:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>So levied in few days his warlike band,
And (league with England&#39;s kind and Scotland&#39;s made)
In Holland and in Friesland left no land
To the false duke, so rapid was the raid.
And to rebel against that lord&#39;s command
His Zealand stirred; nor he the war delayed,
Until by him Bireno&#39;s blood was spilt:
A punishment that ill atoned his guilt.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Oberto takes to wife Olympia fair,
And her of countess makes a puissant queen.
But be the Paladin again our care,
Who furrows , night and day, the billows green,
And strikes his sails in the same harbour, where
They to the wind erewhile unfurled had been
All armed, he on his Brigliadoro leaps,
And leaves behind him winds and briny deeps.</code></pre><blockquote>

<pre><code>The remnant of the winter, he with shield
And spear achieved things worthy to be shown,
I ween; but these were then so well concealed,
It is no fault of mine they are not blown;
For good Orlando was in fighting field,
Prompter to do, than make his prowess known.
Nor e&#39;er was bruited action of the knight,
Save when some faithful witness was in sight.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXII</p>

<pre><code>That winter&#39;s remnant he so passed that feat
Of his was known not to the public ear;
But when within that animal discreet
Which Phryxus bore, the sun illumed the sphere,
And Zephyrus returning glad and sweet,
Brought back with him again the blooming year,
The wondrous deeds Orlando did in stower,
Appeared with the new grass and dainty flower.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>From plain to hill, from champaign flat to shore,
Oppressed with grief and pain the County fares,
When a long cry, entering a forest hoar,
— A load lamenting smites upon his ears.
He grasps his brand and spurs his courser sore,
And swiftly pricks toward the sound he hears.
But I shall at another season say
What chanced, and may be heard in future lay.</code></pre><hr>

<p>ARGUMENT</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Orlando, full of rage, pursues a knight
Who bears by force his lady-love away,
And comes where old Atlantes, by his sleight
Had raised a dome, Rogero there to stay.
Here too Rogero comes; where getting sight
Of his lost love, the County strives in fray
With fierce Ferrau, and, after slaughter fell
Amid the paynim host, finds Isabel.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>I</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Ceres, when from the Idaean dame in haste
Returning to the lonely valley, where
Enceladus the Aetnaean mountain placed
On his bolt-smitten flanks, is doomed to bear,
Her girl she found not, on that pathless waste,
By her late quitted, having rent her hair,
And marked cheeks, eyes, and breast, with livid signs,
At the end of her lament tore up two pines,</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>II</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And lit at Vulcan&#39;s fire the double brand,
And gave them virtue never to be spent;
And, afterwards, with one in either hand,
Drawn by two dragons, in her chariot went,
Searching the forest, hill, and level land,
Field, valley, running stream, or water pent,
The land and sea; and having searched the shell
Of earth above, descended into hell.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>III</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Had Roland of Eleusis&#39; deity
The sovereign power possessed no less than will,
He for Angelica had land and sea
Ransacked, and wood and field, and pool and rill,
Heaven, and Oblivion&#39;s bottom: but since he
Had not, his pressing purpose to fulfil,
Her dragon and her car, the unwearied knight
Pursued the missing maid as best he might.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Through France he sought her, and will seek her through
The realms of Italy and of Almayn,
And thence through the Castiles, both old and new,
So passing into Libya out of Spain.
While bold Orlando has this plan in view,
He hears, or thinks he hears, a voice complain:
He forward spurs, and sees on mighty steed
A warrior trot before him on the mead;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>V</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Who in his arms a captive damsel bears,
Sore grieving, and across the pommel laid;
She weeps and struggles, and the semblance wears
Of cruel woe, and ever calls for aid
Upon Anglantes&#39; prince; and now appears
To him, as he surveys the youthful maid,
She, for whom, night and day, with ceaseless pain,
Inside and out, he France had searched in vain.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>I say not is, but that she to the sight
Seems the Angelica he loves so dear.
He who is lady-love and goddess&#39; flight
Beholds, borne off in such afflicted cheer,
Impelled by fury foul, and angry spite,
Calls back with horrid voice the cavalier;
Calls back the cavalier, and threats in vain,
And Brigliadoro drives with flowing rein.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>That felon stops not, nor to him replies,
On his great gain intent, his glorious prey;
And with such swiftness through the greenwood hies,
Wind would not overtake him on his way.
The one pursues while him the other flies,
And with lament resounds the thicket gray.
They issue in a spacious mead, on which
Appears a lofty mansion, rare and rich.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>VIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Of various marbles, wrought with subtle care,
Is the proud palace.  He who fast in hold
Bears off upon his arm the damsel fair,
Sore pricking, enters at a gate of gold.
Nor Brigliador is far behind the pair,
Backed by Orlando, angry knight and bold.
Entering, around Orlando turns his eyes,
Yet neither cavalier nor damsel spies.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>IX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He suddenly dismounts, and thundering fares
Through the inmost palace, seeking still his foe,
And here and there in restless rage repairs,
Till he has seen each bower, each galleried row;
With the same purpose he ascends the stairs,
Having first vainly searched each room below.
Nor spends less labour, on his task intent,
Above, than he beneath had vainly spent.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>X</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Here beds are seen adorned with silk and gold;
Nor of partition aught is spied or wall:
For these, and floor beneath, throughout that hold,
Are hid by curtains and by carpets all.
Now here, now there, returns Orlando bold,
Nor yet can glad his eyes, in bower or hall,
With the appearance of the royal maid,
Or the foul thief by whom she was conveyed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>This while, as here and there in fruitless pain
He moves, oppressed with thought and trouble sore,
Gradasso, Brandimart, and him of Spain,
Ferrau, he finds, with Sacripant and more;
Who ever toiling, like himself, in vain
Above, that building, and beneath explore,
And as they wander, curse with one accord
The malice of the castle&#39;s viewless lord.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>All in pursuit of the offender speed,
And upon him some charge of robbery lay:
One knight complains that he has stolen his steed,
One that he has purloined his lady gay.
Other accuses him of other deed:
And thus within the enchanted cage they stay,
Nor can depart; while in the palace pent,
Many have weeks and months together spent.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Roland, when he round that strange dome had paced
Four times or six, still vainly seeking, said
Within himself, at last, &quot;I here might waste
My time and trouble, still in vain delayed,
While haply her the robber whom I chased
Has far away, through other gate conveyed.&quot;
So thinking, from the house he issued out
Into the mead which girt the dome about.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>While Roland wanders round the sylvan Hall,
Still holding close his visage to the ground,
To see if recent print or trace withal
Can, right or left, upon the turf be found,
He from a neighbouring window hears a call,
And looks, and thinks he hears that voice&#39;s sound,
And thinks he sees the visage by which he
Was so estranged from what he wont to be.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He thinks he hears Angelica, and she
&quot;Help, help!&quot; entreating cries, and weeping sore,
&quot;More than for life and soul, alas!  of thee
Protection for my honour I implore.
Then shall it in my Roland&#39;s presence be
Ravished by this foul robber?  Oh! before
Me to such miserable fate you leave,
Let me from your own hand my death receive!&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>These words repeated once, and yet again,
Made Roland through each chamber, far and near,
Return with passion, and with utmost pain;
But tempered with high hope.  Sometimes the peer
Stopt in his search and heard a voice complain,
Which seemed to be Angelica&#39;s:  if here
The restless warrior stand, it sounds from there,
And calls for help he knows not whence nor where,</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Returning to Rogero, left, I said,
When through a gloomy path, upon his steed,
Following the giant and the dame who fled,
He from the wood had issued on the mead;
I say that he arrived where Roland dread
Arrived before him, if I rightly read.
The giant through the golden portal passed,
Rogero close behind, who followed fast.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>As soon as he his foot has lifted o&#39;er
The threshold, he through court and gallery spies;
Nor sees the giant or the lady more,
And vainly glances here and there his eyes.
He up and down returns with labour sore,
Yet not for that his longing satisfies;
Nor can imagine where the felon thief
Has hid himself and dame in space so brief.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>After four times or five he so had wound
Above, below, through bower and gallery fair,
He yet returned, and, having nothing found,
Searched even to the space beneath the stair.
At length, in hope they in the woodlands round
Might be, he sallied; but the voice, which there
Roland recalled, did him no less recall,
And made as well return within the Hall.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>One voice, one shape, which to Anglantes&#39; peer
Seemed his Angelica, beseeching aid.
Seemed to Rogero Dordogne&#39;s lady dear.
Who him a truant to himself had made:
If with Gradasso, or with other near
He spake, of those who through the palace strayed.
To all of them the vision, seen apart,
Seemed that which each had singly most at heart.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>This was a new and unwonted spell,
Which the renowned Atlantes had composed,
That in this toil, this pleasing pain, might dwell
So long Rogero, by these walls enclosed,
From him should pass away  the influence fell,
— Influence which him to early death exposed.
Though vain his magic tower of steel, and vain
Alcina&#39;s art, Atlantes plots again.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Not only he, but others who stood high
For valour, and in France had greatest fame,
That by their hands Rogero might not die,
Brought here by old Atlantes&#39; magic came:
While these in the enchanted mansion lie,
That food be wanting not to knight or dame,
He has supplied the dome throughout so well,
That all the inmates there in plenty dwell.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But to Angelica return we, who
Now of that ring so wondrous repossessed,
(Which, in her mouth, concealed the maid from view,
Preserved from spell when it the finger pressed,)
Was in the mountain-cavern guided to
Whatever needed, viands, mare, and vest,
And had conceived the project to pursue
Her way to her fair Indian realm anew.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>King Sacripant, or Roland, willingly
The damsel would have taken for her guide;
Not that, propitious to their wishes, she
(Averse from both inclined to either side; ) 

But, since her eastern journey was to be
Through town and city, scattered far and wide,
She needed company, and ill had found
More trusty guides than these for such a round.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Now this, now that she sought with fruitless care,
Before she lit on either warrior&#39;s trace,
By city or by farm, now here, now there,
In forest now, and now in other place.
Fortune, at length, where caged with Roland are
Ferrau and Sacripant, directs her chase;
Rogero, with Gradasso fierce, and more,
Noosed with strange witcheries by Atlantes hoar.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>She enters, hidden from the enchanter&#39;s eyes,
And by the ring concealed, examines all;
And Roland there, and Sacripant espies,
Intent to seek her vainly through the Hall;
And with her image cheating both, descries
Atlantes old.  The damsel doubts withal
Which of the two to take, and long revolves
This in her doubtful thought, nor well resolves.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>She knows not which with her will best accord,
The Count Orlando or Circassia&#39;s knight.
As of most powers, her would Rogero ward
In passage perilous, with better might.
But should she make the peer her guide, her lord,
She knew not if her champion she could slight,
If him she would depress with altered cheer,
Or into France send back the cavalier:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But Sacripant at pleasure could depose,
Though him she had uplifted to the sky.
Hence him alone she for her escort chose,
And feigned to trust in his fidelity.
The ring she from her mouth withdraws, and shows
Her face, unveiled to the Circassian&#39;s eye:
She thought to him alone; but fierce Ferrau
And Roland came upon the maid, and saw.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Ferrau and Roland came upon the maid;
For one and the other champion equally
Within the palace and without it strayed
In quest of her, who was their deity.
And now, no longer by the enchantment stayed,
Each ran alike towards the dame, for she
Had placed the ring upon her hand anew,
Which old Atlantes&#39; every scheme o&#39;erthrew.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Helm on the head and corselet on the breast
Of both the knights, of whom I sing, was tied;
By night or day, since they into this rest
Had entered, never doffed and laid aside:
For such to wear were easy as a vest,
To these, so wont the burden to abide.
As well was armed, except with iron masque,
Ferrau, who wore not, nor would wear, a casque.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Till he had that erst wrested by the peer,
Orlando, from the brother of Troyane;
For so had sworn the Spanish cavalier,
What time he Argalia&#39;s helm in vain
Sought in the brook; yet though the count was near,
Has not stretched forth his hand the prize to gain.
For so it was, that neither of the pair
Could recognise the other knight while there.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Upon the enchanted dome lay such a spell,
That they from one another were concealed;
They doffed not, night nor day, the corselet&#39;s shell,
Not sword, nor even put aside the shield.
Saddled, with bridle hanging at the sell,
Their steeds were feeding, ready for the field,
Within a chamber, near the palace door,
With straw and barley heaped in plenteous store.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Nor might nor mean in old Atlantes lies
To stop the knights from mounting, who repair
To their good steeds, to chase the bright black eyes,
The fair vermillion cheeks and golden hair
Of the sweet damsel, who before them flies,
And goads to better speed her panting mare;
Ill pleased the three assembled to discern,
Though haply she had taken each in turn.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And when these from the magic palace she
Had ticed so far, that she no more supposed
The warriors to the wicked fallacy
Of the malign enchanter were exposed,
The ring, which more than once from misery
Had rescued her, she &#39;twixt her lips enclosed,
Hence from their sight she vanished in a thought,
And left them wondering there, like men distraught.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Although she first the scheme had entertained
Roland or Sacripant to have released,
To guide her thither, where her father reigned,
King Galaphron, who ruled i&#39; the farthest East,
The aid of both she suddenly disdained,
And in an instant from her project ceased;
And deemed, without more debt to count or king,
In place of either knight sufficed the ring.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>In haste, they through the forest, here and there,
So scorned of her, still gaze with stupid face;
Like questing hound which loses sight of hare
Or fox, of whom he late pursued the trace,
Into close thicket, ditch, or narrow lair,
Escaping from the keen pursuer&#39;s chase.
Meantime their ways the wanton Indian queen
Observes, and at their wonder laughs unseen.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>In the mid wood, where they the maid did lose,
Was but a single pathway, left or right;
Which they believed the damsel could not choose
But follow, when she vanished from their sight.
Ferrau halts not, and Roland fast pursues,
Nor Sacripant less plies the rowels bright.
Angelica, this while, retrains her steed,
And follows the three warriors with less speed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>When pricking thus they came to where the way
Was in the forest lost, with wood o&#39;ergrown,
And had begun the herbage to survey
For print of recent footsteps, up and down,
The fierce Ferrau, who might have borne away
From all that ever proudest were, the crown,
With evil countenance, to the other two
Turned him about, and shouted &quot;Whence are you?&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XXXIX</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Turn back or take another road, save here,
In truth, you covet to be slain by me.
Nor when I chase or woo my lady dear,
Let any think I bear with company.&quot;
And — &quot;What more could he say, sir cavalier,&quot;
(Orlando cried to Sacripant &quot;if we ) 

Were known for the two basest whores that pull
And reel from spindle-staff the matted wool?&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XL</p>

<pre><code>Then turning to Ferrau,, &quot;But that thine head,
Thou brutish sot, as I behold, is bare,
If thy late words were ill or wisely said,
Thou should&#39;st perceive, before we further fare.&quot;
To him Ferrau:  &quot;For that which breeds no dread
In me, why should&#39;st thou take such sovereign care?
What I have said unhelmed will I prove true,
Here, single as I am, on both of you.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Oh!&quot; (to Circassia&#39;s king cried Roland dread)
&quot;Thy morion for this man let me entreat,
Till I have driven such folly from his head;
For never with like madness did I meet.&quot;
— &quot;Who then would be most fool?&quot; the monarch said;

Lend him thine own; nor shall I be less fit
Haply than thee to school his lack of wit.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>— &quot;Fools, both of you!&quot; (the fierce Ferrau replied)
&quot;As if, did I to wear a helm delight,
You would not be without your casques of pride,
Already reft by me in your despite;
But know thus much, that I by vow am tied
To wear no helm, and thus my promise quite;
Roaming without, till that fine casque I win
Worn by Orlando, Charles&#39;s paladin.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>— &quot;Then&quot; (smiling, to the Spaniard said the count)
&quot;With naked head, thou thinkest to repeat
On Roland what he did in Aspramont,
By Agolant&#39;s bold son: but shouldst thou meet
The warrior whom thou seekest, front to front,
I warrant thou wouldst quake from head to feet;
Nor only wouldst forego the casque, but give
The knight thine other arms to let thee live.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>— &quot;So oft have I had Roland on the hip,
And oft,&quot; (exclaimed the boaster &quot;heretofore; ) 

From him it had been easy task to strip
What other arms, beside his helm, he wore;
And if I still have let the occasion slip,
— We sometimes think of things unwished before:
Such wish I had not; I have now; and hope
To compass easily my present scope.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The good Orlando could no more forbear,
And cried, &quot;Foul miscreant, liar, marched with me,
Say, caitiff, in what country, when and where
Boast you to have obtained such victory?
That paladin am I, o&#39;er whom you dare
To vaunt, and whom you distant deemed: now see
If you can take my helm, or I have might
To take your other arms in your despite.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;Nor I o&#39;er you the smallest vantage wou&#39;d.&quot;
He ended, and his temples disarrayed,
And to a beech hung up the helmet good,
And nigh as quickly bared his trenchant blade.
Ferrau stands close, and in such attitude,
(His courage not for what had chanced dismayed)
Covered with lifted shield and naked sword,
As might best shelter to his head afford.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&#39;Twas thus those warriors two, with faulchions bare,
Turning their ready steeds, began to wheel;
And where the armour thinnest was, and where
The meeting plates were joined, probed steel with steel;
Nor was there in the world another pair
More fitted to be matched in fierce appeal:
Equal their daring, equal was their might,
And safe alike from wound was either knight.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>By you, fair sir, already, I presume,
That fierce Ferrau was charmed is understood,
Save where the child, enclosed within the womb
Of the full mother, takes its early food;
And hence he ever, till the squalid tomb
Covered his manly face, wore harness good
(Such was his wont the doubtful part to guard, ) 

Of seven good plates of metal, tempered hard.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XLIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Alike a charmed life Orlando bore,
Safe every where, except a single part:
Unfenced beneath his feet, which evermore
By him were guarded with all care and art.
The rest than diamond dug from mountain hoar
More hard, unless report from truth depart;
And armed to battle either champion went,
Less for necessity than ornament.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>L</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Waxing more fierce and fell the combat rages,
Of fear and horror full, between the twain:
The fierce Ferrau such dreadful battle wages,
That stroke or thrust is never dealt in vain:
Each mighty blow from Roland disengages
And loosens, breaks, or shatters, plate and chain.
Angelica alone, secure from view,
Regards such fearful sight, and marks the two.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>For, during this, the king of Circassy,
Who deemed Angelica not far before,
When Ferrau and Orlando desperately
Closing in fight were seen, his horse did gore
Along the way by which he deemed that she
Had disappeared; and so that battle sore
Was witnessed &#39;twixt the struggling foes, by none,
Beside the daughter of king Galaphron.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>After the damsel had sometime descried
This dread and direful combat, standing nigh;
And it appearing that on either side
With equal peril both the warriors vie,
She, fond of novelty, the helm untied
Designs to take; desirous to espy
What they would do when they perceived the wrong;
But, without thought to keep her plunder long.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>To give it to Orlando was she bent,
But first she would upon the warrior play:
The helmet she took down with this intent
And in her bosom hid, and marked the fray:
Next thence, without a word to either went,
And from the scene of strife was far away
Ere either of the two had marked the feat;
So were they blinded by their angry heat.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But Ferrau, who first chanced the loss to see,
From Roland disengaged himself, and cried,
&quot;How like unwary men and fools are we
Treated by him, who late with us did ride!
What meed, which worthiest of the strife might be,
If this be stolen, the victor shall abide?&quot;
Roland draws back, looks upward, and with ire,
Missing the noble casque, is all on fire:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And in opinion with Ferrau agreed,
That he the knight, who was with them before,
Had born away the prize: hence turned his steed.
And with the spur admonished Brigliador.
Ferrau, who from the field beheld him speed.
Followed him, and when Roland and the Moor
Arrived where tracks upon the herbage green
Of the Circassian and the maid were seen,</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Towards a vale upon the left the count
Went off, pursuing the Circassian&#39;s tread;
The Spaniard kept the path more nigh the mount,
By which the fair Angelica had fled.
Angelica, this while, has reached a fount,
Of pleasant site, and shaded overhead;
By whose inviting shades no traveller hasted,
Nor ever left the chrystal wave untasted.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Angelica, the sylvan spring beside,
Reposes, unsuspicious of surprise;
And thinking her the sacred ring will hide,
Fears not that evil accident can rise.
On her arrival at the fountain&#39;s side,
She to a branch above the helmet ties;
Then seeks the fittest sapling for her need,
Where, fastened to its trunk, her mare may feed.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The Spanish cavalier the stream beside
Arrived, who had pursued her traces there:
Angelica no sooner him espied,
Than she evanished clean, and spurred her mare:
The helm this while had dropt, but lay too wide
To be recovered of the flying fair.
As soon as sweet Angelica he saw,
Towards her full of rapture sprang Ferrau.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>She disappeared, I say, as forms avaunt
At sleep&#39;s departure: toiling long and sore
He seeks the damsel there, &#39;twixt plant and plant,
Now can his wretched eyes behold her more.
Blaspheming his Mahound and Termagant,
And cursing every master of his lore,
Ferrau returned towards the sylvan fount,
Where lay on earth the helmet of the count.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>This he soon recognised, for here he read
Letters upon the margin, written fair,
Which how Orlando won the helmet said;
And from what champion took, and when and where.
With it the paynim armed his neck and head,
Who would not for his grief the prize forbear;
His grief for loss of her, conveyed from sight,
As disappear the phantoms of the night.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>When in this goodly casque he was arrayed,
He deemed nought wanting to his full content,
But the discovery of the royal maid,
Who like a flash of lightning came and went:
For her he searches every greenwood shade,
And when all hope of finding her is spent,
He for the vain pursuit no longer tarries,
But to the Spanish camp returns near Paris;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Tempering the grief which glowed within his breast,
For such sore disappointment, with the thought
That he was with Orlando&#39;s morion blest,
As sworn.  By good Anglante&#39;s count, when taught
That the false Saracen the prize possest,
Long time the Spanish knight was vainly sought;
Nor Roland took the helmet from his head,
Till he between two bridges laid him dead.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Angelica thus, viewless and alone,
Speeds on her journey, but with troubled front;
Grieved for the helmet, in her haste foregone
On her departure from the grassy fount.
&quot;Choosing to do what I should least have done,&quot;
(She said &quot;I took his helmet from the count. ) 

This for his first desert I well bestow;
A worthy recompense for all I owe!</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&quot;With good intentions, as God knows, I wrought;
Though these an ill and different end produce;
I took the helmet only with the thought
To bring that deadly battle to a truce;
And not that this foul Spaniard what he sought
Should gain, or I to his intent conduce.&quot;
So she, lamenting, took herself to task
For having robbed Orlando of his casque.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>By what appeared to her the meetest way,
Moody and ill-content she eastward pressed;
Ofttimes concealed, sometimes in face of day,
As seemed most opportune and pleased her best.
After much country seen, a forest gray
She reached, where, sorely wounded in mid breast,
Between two dead companions on the ground,
The royal maid a bleeding stripling found.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>But of Angelica I now no more
Shall speak, who first have many things to say;
Nor shall to the Circassian or the Moor
Give for long space a rhyme; thence called away
By good Anglante&#39;s prince, who wills, before
I of those others tell, I should display
The labours and the troubles he sustained,
Pursuing the great good he never gained.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>At the first city, whither he was brought
(Because to go concealed he had good care),
He a new helmet donned; but took no thought
What was the head-piece he designed to bear.
So safe is he in fairy spell, it nought
Imports, if hard or soft its temper were.
Orlando, covered thus, pursues the quest,
Nor him day, night, or rain, or sun arrest.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>It was the hour that our of Ocean&#39;s bed
Dan Phoebus drew his dripping steeds, and high
And low, still scattering yellow flowers and red,
Aurora stained the heavens with various dye,
And Stars had cast their veils about their head,
Departing from their revels in the sky;
When passing on a day fair Paris near,
Orlando made his mighty worth appear.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Two squadrons he encountered; one an old
Saracen, Manilardo clept, obeyed;
King of Noritia, whilom fierce and bold.
But fitter now to counsel than to aid.
The next beneath the standard was enrolled
Or Tremisena&#39;s monarch, who was said
&#39;Mid Africans to be a perfect knight;
Alzirdo he by those who knew him, hight:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>These, with the other Saracen array,
Cantoned throughout the winter months had lain,
Some near the city, some more far away,
All lodged nigh town or hamlet on the plain.
For since King Agramant had many a day
Spent in attacking Paris&#39; walls in vain,
He (for no other means remained to try)
Would lastly with a siege the city ply;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>And to do this had people infinite:
Since he, beside the host that with him came,
And that of Spain which followed to the fight
The Spanish King Marsilius&#39; oriflame,
Many of France did in his pay unite:
For all from Paris he to Arles&#39;s stream,
With part of Gascony, some straggling tower
Excepted, had reduced beneath his power.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>The quivering brook, as warmer breezes blew,
Beginning now from ice its waves to free,
And the fresh-springing grass and foliage new,
To cloathe again the field and greenwood tree,
All those King Agramant assembled, who
Had followed him in his prosperity;
To muster in review the armed swarm,
And give to his affairs a better form:</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Hence did the King of Tremisen&#39; repair,
With him who had Noritia in command,
To be in time at that full muster, where
Each squadron, good or bad, was to be scanned
Orlando thus by chance encountered there,
As I have told you, this united hand;
Who, as his usage was, went seeking her,
By whom he had been made Love&#39;s prisoner.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Alzirdo, as the approaching count he eyes,
Who in this world for valour has no peer,
With such a haughty front, and in such guise,
The God of war would less in arms appear,
The features known before astounded spies,
The fierce, disdainful glance and furious cheer;
And him esteems a knight of prowess high,
Which, fondly, he too sore desires to try.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Arrogant, young, and of redoubted force,
Alzirdo was, and prized for dauntless mind;
Who bent to joust pricked forth his foaming horse,
Happier had he remained in line behind!
Met by Anglante&#39;s prince in middle course,
Who pierced his heart as they encountering joined.
Frighted, the lightened courser scoured the plain,
Without a rider to direct the rein.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Rises a sudden and a horrid cry,
And air on every side repeats the scream;
As his scared band the falling youth descry,
And issuing from his wound so wide a stream:
Disordered, they the count in fury ply,
And, raised to cut or thrust, their weapons gleam.
Against that flower of knights, their feathered reeds,
A thicker squadron yet in tempest speeds.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>With sound like that, with which from hill repair,
Or from the champaign&#39;s flat the hurrying swine,
(If the Wolf, issue from his grot, or Bear,
Descending to the mountains&#39; lower line,
Some bristly youngling take away and tear,
Who with loud squeal and grunt is heard to pine)
Came driving at the count the barbarous rout;
&quot;Upon him!&quot; and &quot;upon him!&quot; still their shout.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>At once spears, shafts, and swords, his corslet bore
By thousands, and as many pierce his shield.
This threatens on one side, and that before,
And those the ponderous mace behind him wield.
But he esteems the craven rout no more.
He, who did never yet to terror yield,
Than hungry Wolf in twilight makes account
To what the number of the flock may mount.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He held unsheathed that thundering sword in hand,
Which with so many foes has heaped the plain,
That he who thinks to count the slaughtered band,
Has undertaken, hard emprize and vain.
The road ran red, ensanguined by his brand,
And scarce capacious of the many slain.
For neither targe nor head-piece good defends,
Where fatal Durindana&#39;s blade descends.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Nor safety cotton vest, nor cloths supply,
In thousand folds about the temples spread:
Nor only groan and lamentation fly
Through air, but shoulder, arm, and severed head,
Death roams the field in strange variety
Of horrid forms, and all inspiring dread;
And says, &quot;For hundreds of my scythes may stand
His Durindana in Orlando&#39;s hand.&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>His ceaseless strokes scarce one the other wait:
Speedily all his foemen are in flight.
And when before they came at furious rate,
They hoped to swallow quick the single knight.
None is there who, in that unhappy straight,
Stops for his comrade, flying from the fight.
Here one man speeds afoot, one gallops there;
None stays to question if the road be fair.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>His mirror Valour bore about, and here
Each blemish of the soul was seen confest:
None looked therein, except an aged peer,
Whose blood was chilled, but courage unreprest.
That death were better deems this cavalier
Than life in flight, and in disgrace possest:
I mean Noritia&#39;s king, who lays his lance
In rest against the paladin of France;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He broke it on the border of the shield
Of the intrepid count, with stedfast hand,
Who, by the stroke unshaken, nothing reeled:
And smote the king, in passing, with his brand.
Him Fortune saved; for as Orlando wheeled
The blade, it turned, descending, in his hand.
Although an-edge he guides not still the sword,
Stunned from his saddle reels the paynim lord.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Astounded from his saddle reels the king,
Nor him Orlando turns about to see.
He cuts, and cleaves, and slays his following;
Who all believe him at their backs to be.
As through the spacious air, with troubled wing,
The starlings from the daring merlin flee;
So, of that broken squadron, scattered round,
Some fly, some dip, and some fall flat to ground.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>He ceased not his ensanguined blade to sway
Till living wight remained not in his view.
Orlando doubted to resume his way,
Although the country all about he knew.
Does he the right or left-hand road assay,
His thoughts still rove from what his steps pursue,
And he to seek the damsel is in dread
Through other path than that by which she fled.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXVI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Through wood and field his courser did he goad,
Often inquiring for the royal dame:
Beside himself, he strayed beside his road,
And to the foot of rising mountain came,
Whence (it was night-time through a fissure glowed ) 

The distant flicker of a quivering flame.
Orlando to the rock approached, to spy
If there Angelica concealed might lie.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXVII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>As where low junipers o&#39;er shade her lair,
Or in the stubble of the open lay,
What time the hunters seek the fearful hare
Through traversed woods, and through uncertain way,
— Lest peradventure she be hidden there,
They every bramble, every bush assay;
Even so, where hope the toiling warrior leads,
Searching his lady-love, Orlando speeds.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXVIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Pricking in haste towards that ray, the count
Arrived where in the wood the light was shed,
Forth-streaming from a crevice in the mount,
Within whose womb a spacious grotto spread;
And there, like wall or bank, discerned in front,
Of thorns and underwood a bristly bed,
To hide the grotto&#39;s inmates, and defend
From scathe or scorn, which others might intend.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>LXXXIX</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>By day it had been hidden evermore;
But the clear flame betrayed the haunt by night.
Its use he guessed; but would the place explore,
And better certify himself by sight.
When he without had tied his Brigliador,
In silence to the grotto stole the knight;
Threading the shrubs; nor calling for a guide,
Entered the passage in the mountain&#39;s side.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XC</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>By a long flight of steps was the descent
Into the cave; where, in the rocky tomb,
Buried were living folk.  Of wide extent,
The grot was chiselled into vaulted room;
Nor was, although its entrance little lent,
All daylight wanting to disperse the gloom:
For much was furnished by a window dight,
Within a natural fissure on the right.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XCI</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>In the mid cave, beside a fire was seen
A gentle maid of pleasing look and guise;
Who seemed to Roland little past fifteen,
As far as at first sight he might surmise.
With that so fair she made the rugged scene
Seem in the warrior&#39;s sight a paradise.
Although this while her eyes with tears o&#39;erflow,
Clear tokens of a heart oppressed with woe.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XCII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>An aged dame was with her, and the pair
Wrangled, as oftentimes is women&#39;s way;
But when the County was descending there,
Concluded the dispute and wordy fray.
Orlando hastens to salute them fair
(As still is due to womankind and they ) 

To welcome him rise lightly form their seat,
And with benign return the warrior greet.</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XCIII</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&#39;Tis true, that when that sudden voice they hear,
Somedeal confused in look they seem to be,
At the same time beholding thus appear
So fierce a wight, and harnessed cap-a-pee.
&quot;What wight&quot; (demands Anglantes&#39; cavalier)
So barbarous is, and void of courtesy,
That he keeps buried, in this rude repair,
A face so gentle and so passing fair?&quot;</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>XCIV</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>With pain the virgin to the count replies,
As he inquires of her unhappy doom,
In sweet and broken accents, which by sighs
Impelled, through rows of pearl and coral come:
And between rose and lily, from her eyes
Tears fall so fast, she needs must swallow some.
In other canto, sir, be pleased to attend
The rest, for here &#39;tis time my strain should end.</code></pre><hr>
